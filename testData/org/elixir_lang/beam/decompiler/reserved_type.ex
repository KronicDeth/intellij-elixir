  #   @type unquote(:"fn") :: function()

  # `in` is a reserved Elixir word and cannot name an Elixir type (`@type` takes no `unquote` fragment); the Erlang type is preserved as a comment:
  #   @type unquote(:"in")(t) :: [t]

  # `nil` is a reserved Elixir word and cannot name an Elixir type (`@type` takes no `unquote` fragment); the Erlang type is preserved as a comment:
  #   @type nil :: []
