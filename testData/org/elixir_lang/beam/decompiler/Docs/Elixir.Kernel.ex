defmodule Kernel do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  `Kernel` is Elixir's default environment.

  It mainly consists of:

    * basic language primitives, such as arithmetic operators, spawning of processes,
      data type handling, and others
    * macros for control-flow and defining new functionality (modules, functions, and the like)
    * guard checks for augmenting pattern matching

  You can invoke `Kernel` functions and macros anywhere in Elixir code
  without the use of the `Kernel.` prefix since they have all been
  automatically imported. For example, in IEx, you can call:

      iex> is_number(13)
      true

  If you don't want to import a function or macro from `Kernel`, use the `:except`
  option and then list the function/macro by arity:

      import Kernel, except: [if: 2, unless: 2]

  See `Kernel.SpecialForms.import/2` for more information on importing.

  Elixir also has special forms that are always imported and
  cannot be skipped. These are described in `Kernel.SpecialForms`.

  ## The standard library

  `Kernel` provides the basic capabilities the Elixir standard library
  is built on top of. It is recommended to explore the standard library
  for advanced functionality. Here are the main groups of modules in the
  standard library (this list is not a complete reference, see the
  documentation sidebar for all entries).

  ### Built-in types

  The following modules handle Elixir built-in data types:

    * `Atom` - literal constants with a name (`true`, `false`, and `nil` are atoms)
    * `Float` - numbers with floating point precision
    * `Function` - a reference to code chunk, created with the `fn/1` special form
    * `Integer` - whole numbers (not fractions)
    * `List` - collections of a variable number of elements (linked lists)
    * `Map` - collections of key-value pairs
    * `Process` - light-weight threads of execution
    * `Port` - mechanisms to interact with the external world
    * `Tuple` - collections of a fixed number of elements

  There are two data types without an accompanying module:

    * Bitstring - a sequence of bits, created with `Kernel.SpecialForms.<<>>/1`.
      When the number of bits is divisible by 8, they are called binaries and can
      be manipulated with Erlang's `:binary` module
    * Reference - a unique value in the runtime system, created with `make_ref/0`

  ### Data types

  Elixir also provides other data types that are built on top of the types
  listed above. Some of them are:

    * `Date` - `year-month-day` structs in a given calendar
    * `DateTime` - date and time with time zone in a given calendar
    * `Exception` - data raised from errors and unexpected scenarios
    * `MapSet` - unordered collections of unique elements
    * `NaiveDateTime` - date and time without time zone in a given calendar
    * `Keyword` - lists of two-element tuples, often representing optional values
    * `Range` - inclusive ranges between two integers
    * `Regex` - regular expressions
    * `String` - UTF-8 encoded binaries representing characters
    * `Time` - `hour:minute:second` structs in a given calendar
    * `URI` - representation of URIs that identify resources
    * `Version` - representation of versions and requirements

  ### System modules

  Modules that interface with the underlying system, such as:

    * `IO` - handles input and output
    * `File` - interacts with the underlying file system
    * `Path` - manipulates file system paths
    * `System` - reads and writes system information

  ### Protocols

  Protocols add polymorphic dispatch to Elixir. They are contracts
  implementable by data types. See `Protocol` for more information on
  protocols. Elixir provides the following protocols in the standard library:

    * `Collectable` - collects data into a data type
    * `Enumerable` - handles collections in Elixir. The `Enum` module
      provides eager functions for working with collections, the `Stream`
      module provides lazy functions
    * `Inspect` - converts data types into their programming language
      representation
    * `List.Chars` - converts data types to their outside world
      representation as charlists (non-programming based)
    * `String.Chars` - converts data types to their outside world
      representation as strings (non-programming based)

  ### Process-based and application-centric functionality

  The following modules build on top of processes to provide concurrency,
  fault-tolerance, and more.

    * `Agent` - a process that encapsulates mutable state
    * `Application` - functions for starting, stopping and configuring
      applications
    * `GenServer` - a generic client-server API
    * `Registry` - a key-value process-based storage
    * `Supervisor` - a process that is responsible for starting,
      supervising and shutting down other processes
    * `Task` - a process that performs computations
    * `Task.Supervisor` - a supervisor for managing tasks exclusively

  ### Supporting documents

  Elixir documentation also includes supporting documents under the
  "Pages" section. Those are:

    * [Compatibility and Deprecations](compatibility-and-deprecations.md) - lists
      compatibility between every Elixir version and Erlang/OTP, release schema;
      lists all deprecated functions, when they were deprecated and alternatives
    * [Library Guidelines](library-guidelines.md) - general guidelines, anti-patterns,
      and rules for those writing libraries
    * [Naming Conventions](naming-conventions.md) - naming conventions for Elixir code
    * [Operators](operators.md) - lists all Elixir operators and their precedences
    * [Patterns and Guards](patterns-and-guards.md) - an introduction to patterns,
      guards, and extensions
    * [Syntax Reference](syntax-reference.md) - the language syntax reference
    * [Typespecs](typespecs.md)- types and function specifications, including list of types
    * [Unicode Syntax](unicode-syntax.md) - outlines Elixir support for Unicode
    * [Writing Documentation](writing-documentation.md) - guidelines for writing
      documentation in Elixir

  ## Guards

  This module includes the built-in guards used by Elixir developers.
  They are a predefined set of functions and macros that augment pattern
  matching, typically invoked after the `when` operator. For example:

      def drive(%User{age: age}) when age >= 16 do
        ...
      end

  The clause above will only be invoked if the user's age is more than
  or equal to 16. Guards also support joining multiple conditions with
  `and` and `or`. The whole guard is true if all guard expressions will
  evaluate to `true`. A more complete introduction to guards is available
  [in the "Patterns and Guards" page](patterns-and-guards.md).

  ## Inlining

  Some of the functions described in this module are inlined by
  the Elixir compiler into their Erlang counterparts in the
  [`:erlang` module](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html).
  Those functions are called BIFs (built-in internal functions)
  in Erlang-land and they exhibit interesting properties, as some
  of them are allowed in guards and others are used for compiler
  optimizations.

  Most of the inlined functions can be seen in effect when
  capturing the function:

      iex> &Kernel.is_atom/1
      &:erlang.is_atom/1

  Those functions will be explicitly marked in their docs as
  "inlined by the compiler".

  ## Truthy and falsy values

  Besides the booleans `true` and `false`, Elixir has the
  concept of a "truthy" or "falsy" value.

    *  a value is truthy when it is neither `false` nor `nil`
    *  a value is falsy when it is either `false` or `nil`

  Elixir has functions, like `and/2`, that *only* work with
  booleans, but also functions that work with these
  truthy/falsy values, like `&&/2` and `!/1`.

  ### Examples

  We can check the truthiness of a value by using the `!/1`
  function twice.

  Truthy values:

      iex> !!true
      true
      iex> !!5
      true
      iex> !![1,2]
      true
      iex> !!"foo"
      true

  Falsy values (of which there are exactly two):

      iex> !!false
      false
      iex> !!nil
      false

  Boolean "not" operator.

  Receives any value (not just booleans) and returns `true` if `value`

  Boolean "and" operator.

  Provides a short-circuit operator that evaluates and returns
  the second expression only if the first one evaluates to a truthy value
  (neither `false` nor `nil`). Returns the first expression
  otherwise.

  Not allowed in guard clauses.

  ## Examples

      iex> x
      "bar"

    )
  end

  @doc ~S"""
  Module attribute unary operator. Reads and writes attributes in the current module.

  The canonical example for attributes is annotating that a module
  implements an OTP behaviour, such as `GenServer`:

      defmodule MyServer do
        @behaviour GenServer
        # ... callbacks ...
      end

  By default Elixir supports all the module attributes supported by Erlang, but
  custom attributes can be used as well:

      defmodule MyServer do
        @my_data 13
        IO.inspect(@my_data)
        #=> 13
      end

  Unlike Erlang, such attributes are not stored in the module by default since
  it is common in Elixir to use custom attributes to store temporary data that
  will be available at compile-time. Custom attributes may be configured to
  behave closer to Erlang by using `Module.register_attribute/3`.

  Finally, note that attributes can also be read inside functions:

      defmodule MyServer do
        @my_data 11
        def first_data, do: @my_data
        @my_data 13
        def second_data, do: @my_data
      end

      MyServer.first_data()
      #=> 11

      MyServer.second_data()
      #=> 13

  It is important to note that reading an attribute takes a snapshot of
  its current value. In other words, the value is read at compilation
  time and not at runtime. Check the `Module` module for other functions
  to manipulate module attributes.

  Defines a public function with the given name and body.

  ## Examples

      defmodule Foo do
        def bar, do: :baz
      end

      Foo.bar()
      #=> :baz

  A function that expects arguments can be defined as follows:

      defmodule Foo do
        def sum(a, b) do
          a + b
        end
      end

  In the example above, a `sum/2` function is defined; this function receives
  two arguments and returns their sum.

  ## Default arguments

  `\\` is used to specify a default value for a parameter of a function. For
  example:

      defmodule MyMath do
        def multiply_by(number, factor \\ 2) do
          number * factor
        end
      end

      MyMath.multiply_by(4, 3)
      #=> 12

      MyMath.multiply_by(4)
      #=> 8

  The compiler translates this into multiple functions with different arities,
  here `MyMath.multiply_by/1` and `MyMath.multiply_by/2`, that represent cases when
  arguments for parameters with default values are passed or not passed.

  When defining a function with default arguments as well as multiple
  explicitly declared clauses, you must write a function head that declares the
  defaults. For example:

      defmodule MyString do
        def join(string1, string2 \\ nil, separator \\ " ")

        def join(string1, nil, _separator) do
          string1
        end

        def join(string1, string2, separator) do
          string1 <> separator <> string2
        end
      end

  Note that `\\` can't be used with anonymous functions because they
  can only have a sole arity.

  ## Function and variable names

  Function and variable names have the following syntax:
  A _lowercase ASCII letter_ or an _underscore_, followed by any number of
  _lowercase or uppercase ASCII letters_, _numbers_, or _underscores_.
  Optionally they can end in either an _exclamation mark_ or a _question mark_.

  For variables, any identifier starting with an underscore should indicate an
  unused variable. For example:

      def foo(bar) do
        []
      end
      #=> warning: variable bar is unused

      def foo(_bar) do
        []
      end
      #=> no warning

      def foo(_bar) do
        _bar
      end
      #=> warning: the underscored variable "_bar" is used after being set

  ## `rescue`/`catch`/`after`/`else`

  Function bodies support `rescue`, `catch`, `after`, and `else` as `Kernel.SpecialForms.try/1`
  does (known as "implicit try"). For example, the following two functions are equivalent:

      def convert(number) do
        try do
          String.to_integer(number)
        rescue
          e in ArgumentError -> {:error, e.message}
        end
      end

      def convert(number) do
        String.to_integer(number)
      rescue
        e in ArgumentError -> {:error, e.message}
      end


  """
  defmacro def(call, expr) do
    define(:def, call, expr, __CALLER__)
  end

  @doc ~S"""
  Defines a function that delegates to another module.

  Functions defined with `defdelegate/2` are public and can be invoked from
  outside the module they're defined in, as if they were defined using `def/2`.
  Therefore, `defdelegate/2` is about extending the current module's public API.
  If what you want is to invoke a function defined in another module without
  using its full module name, then use `alias/2` to shorten the module name or use
  `import/2` to be able to invoke the function without the module name altogether.

  Delegation only works with functions; delegating macros is not supported.

  Check `def/2` for rules on naming and default arguments.

  ## Options

    * `:to` - the module to dispatch to.

    * `:as` - the function to call on the target given in `:to`.
      This parameter is optional and defaults to the name being
      delegated (`funs`).

  Defines an exception.

  Exceptions are structs backed by a module that implements

      and returns the exception struct. The default implementation
      accepts either a set of keyword arguments that is merged into
      the struct or a string to be used as the exception's message.

    * [`message/1`](`c:Exception.message/1`) - receives the exception struct and must return its
      message. Most commonly exceptions have a message field which
      by default is accessed by this function. However, if an exception
      does not have a message field, this function must be explicitly
      implemented.

  Since exceptions are structs, the API supported by `defstruct/1`
  is also available in `defexception/1`.

  ## Raising exceptions

  The most common way to raise an exception is via `raise/2`:

      defmodule MyAppError do
        defexception [:message]
      end

      value = [:hello]

      raise MyAppError,
        message: "did not get what was expected, got: #{inspect(value)}"

  In many cases it is more convenient to pass the expected value to
  `raise/2` and generate the message in the `c:Exception.exception/1` callback:

      defmodule MyAppError do
        defexception [:message]

        @impl true
        def exception(value) do
          msg = "did not get what was expected, got: #{inspect(value)}"
          %MyAppError{message: msg}
        end
      end

      raise MyAppError, value

  The example above shows the preferred strategy for customizing
  exception messages.

  Generates a macro suitable for use in guard expressions.

  It raises at compile time if the definition uses expressions that aren't
  allowed in guards, and otherwise creates a macro that can be used both inside
  or outside guards.

  Note the convention in Elixir is to name functions/macros allowed in
  guards with the `is_` prefix, such as `is_list/1`. If, however, the
  function/macro returns a boolean and is not allowed in guards, it should
  have no prefix and end with a question mark, such as `Keyword.keyword?/1`.

        defguard is_even(value) when is_integer(value) and rem(value, 2) == 0

  Defines a module given by name with the given contents.

  This macro defines a module with the given `alias` as its name and with the
  given contents. It returns a tuple with four elements:

    * `:module`
    * the module name
    * the binary contents of the module
    * the result of evaluating the contents block

  ## Examples

      defmodule Number do
        def one, do: 1
        def two, do: 2
      end
      #=> {:module, Number, <<70, 79, 82, ...>>, {:two, 0}}

      Number.one()
      #=> 1

      Number.two()
      #=> 2

  ## Nesting

  Nesting a module inside another module affects the name of the nested module:

      defmodule Foo do
        defmodule Bar do
        end
      end

  In the example above, two modules - `Foo` and `Foo.Bar` - are created.
  When nesting, Elixir automatically creates an alias to the inner module,
  allowing the second module `Foo.Bar` to be accessed as `Bar` in the same
  lexical scope where it's defined (the `Foo` module). This only happens
  if the nested module is defined via an alias.

  If the `Foo.Bar` module is moved somewhere else, the references to `Bar` in
  the `Foo` module need to be updated to the fully-qualified name (`Foo.Bar`) or
  an alias has to be explicitly set in the `Foo` module with the help of
  `Kernel.SpecialForms.alias/2`.

      defmodule Foo.Bar do
        # code
      end

      defmodule Foo do
        alias Foo.Bar
        # code here can refer to "Foo.Bar" as just "Bar"
      end

  ## Dynamic names

  Elixir module names can be dynamically generated. This is very
  useful when working with macros. For instance, one could write:

      defmodule String.to_atom("Foo#{1}") do
        # contents ...
      end

  Elixir will accept any module name as long as the expression passed as the
  first argument to `defmodule/2` evaluates to an atom.
  Note that, when a dynamic name is used, Elixir won't nest the name under
  the current module nor automatically set up an alias.

  ## Reserved module names

  If you attempt to define a module that already exists, you will get a
  warning saying that a module has been redefined.

  There are some modules that Elixir does not currently implement but it
  may be implement in the future. Those modules are reserved and defining
  them will result in a compilation error:

      defmodule Any do
        # code
      end
      ** (CompileError) iex:1: module Any is reserved and cannot be defined

  Elixir reserves the following module names: `Elixir`, `Any`, `BitString`,
  `PID`, and `Reference`.

  Makes the given functions in the current module overridable.

  An overridable function is lazily defined, allowing a developer to override
  it.

  Macros cannot be overridden as functions and vice-versa.

  ## Example

      defmodule DefaultMod do
        defmacro __using__(_opts) do
          quote do
            def test(x, y) do
              x + y

        def test(x, y) do
          x * y + super(x, y)
        end
      end

  As seen as in the example above, `super` can be used to call the default
  implementation.

  If `@behaviour` has been defined, `defoverridable` can also be called with a
  module as an argument. All implemented callbacks from the behaviour above the
  call to `defoverridable` will be marked as overridable.

  Defines a struct.

  A struct is a tagged map that allows developers to provide
  default values for keys, tags to be used in polymorphic
  dispatches and compile time assertions.

  To define a struct, a developer must define both `__struct__/0` and
  `__struct__/1` functions. `defstruct/1` is a convenience macro which
  defines such functions with some conveniences.

  For more information about structs, please check `Kernel.SpecialForms.%/2`.

  ## Examples

      defmodule User do
        defstruct name: nil, age: nil
      end

  Struct fields are evaluated at compile-time, which allows
  them to be dynamic. In the example below, `10 + 11` is
  evaluated at compile-time and the age field is stored
  with value `21`:

      defmodule User do
        defstruct name: nil, age: 10 + 11
      end

  The `fields` argument is usually a keyword list with field names
  as atom keys and default values as corresponding values. `defstruct/1`
  also supports a list of atoms as its argument: in that case, the atoms
  in the list will be used as the struct's field names and they will all
  default to `nil`.

      defmodule Post do
        defstruct [:title, :content, :author]
      end

  ## Deriving

  Although structs are maps, by default structs do not implement
  any of the protocols implemented for maps. For example, attempting
  to use a protocol with the `User` struct leads to an error:

      john = %User{name: "John"}
      MyProtocol.call(john)
      ** (Protocol.UndefinedError) protocol MyProtocol not implemented for %User{...}

  `defstruct/1`, however, allows protocol implementations to be
  *derived*. This can be done by defining a `@derive` attribute as a
  list before invoking `defstruct/1`:

      defmodule User do
        @derive [MyProtocol]
        defstruct name: nil, age: 10 + 11
      end

      MyProtocol.call(john) # it works!

  For each protocol in the `@derive` list, Elixir will assert the protocol has
  been implemented for `Any`. If the `Any` implementation defines a
  `__deriving__/3` callback, the callback will be invoked and it should define
  the implementation module. Otherwise an implementation that simply points to
  the `Any` implementation is automatically derived. For more information on
  the `__deriving__/3` callback, see `Protocol.derive/3`.

  ## Enforcing keys

  When building a struct, Elixir will automatically guarantee all keys
  belongs to the struct:

      %User{name: "john", unknown: :key}
      ** (KeyError) key :unknown not found in: %User{age: 21, name: nil}

  Elixir also allows developers to enforce certain keys must always be
  given when building the struct:

      defmodule User do
        @enforce_keys [:name]
        defstruct name: nil, age: 10 + 11
      end

  Now trying to build a struct without the name key will fail:

      %User{age: 21}
      ** (ArgumentError) the following keys must also be given when building struct User: [:name]

  Keep in mind `@enforce_keys` is a simple compile-time guarantee
  to aid developers when building structs. It is not enforced on
  updates and it does not provide any sort of value-validation.

  ## Types

  It is recommended to define types for structs. By convention such type
  is called `t`. To define a struct inside a type, the struct literal syntax
  is used:

      defmodule User do
        defstruct name: "John", age: 25
        @type t :: %__MODULE__{name: String.t(), age: non_neg_integer}
      end

  It is recommended to only use the struct syntax when defining the struct's
  type. When referring to another struct it's better to use `User.t` instead of
  `%User{}`.

  The types of the struct fields that are not included in `%User{}` default to
  `term()` (see `t:term/0`).

  Structs whose internal structure is private to the local module (pattern
  matching them or directly accessing their fields should not be allowed) should
  use the `@opaque` attribute. Structs whose internal structure is public should
  use `@type`.

  Destructures two lists, assigning each term in the
  right one to the matching term in the left one.

  Unlike pattern matching via `=`, if the sizes of the left
  and right lists don't match, destructuring simply stops
  instead of raising an error.

  ## Examples

      iex> destructure([x, y, z], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
      iex> {x, y, z}
      {1, 2, 3}

  In the example above, even though the right list has more entries than the
  left one, destructuring works fine. If the right list is smaller, the
  remaining elements are simply set to `nil`:

      iex> destructure([x, y, z], [1])
      iex> {x, y, z}
      {1, nil, nil}

  The left-hand side supports any expression you would use
  on the left-hand side of a match:

      x = 1
      destructure([^x, y, z], [1, 2, 3])

  The example above will only work if `x` matches the first value in the right
  list. Otherwise, it will raise a `MatchError` (like the `=` operator would
  do).

  Gets a value and updates a nested data structure via the given `path`.

  This is similar to `get_and_update_in/3`, except the path is extracted
  via a macro rather than passing a list. For example:

      get_and_update_in(opts[:foo][:bar], &{&1, &1 + 1})

  Is equivalent to:

      get_and_update_in(opts, [:foo, :bar], &{&1, &1 + 1})

  This also works with nested structs and the `struct.path.to.value` way to specify
  paths:

      get_and_update_in(struct.foo.bar, &{&1, &1 + 1})

  Note that in order for this macro to work, the complete path must always
  be visible by this macro. See the "Paths" section below.

  ## Examples

      iex> users = %{"john" => %{age: 27}, "meg" => %{age: 23}}
      iex> get_and_update_in(users["john"].age, &{&1, &1 + 1})
      {27, %{"john" => %{age: 28}, "meg" => %{age: 23}}}

  ## Paths

  A path may start with a variable, local or remote call, and must be
  followed by one or more:

    * `foo[bar]` - accesses the key `bar` in `foo`; in case `foo` is nil,
      `nil` is returned

    * `foo.bar` - accesses a map/struct field; in case the field is not
      present, an error is raised

  Here are some valid paths:

      users["john"][:age]
      users["john"].age
      User.all()["john"].age
      all_users()["john"].age

  Here are some invalid ones:

      # Does a remote call after the initial value
      users["john"].do_something(arg1, arg2)

      # Does not access any key or field
      users

    )

  @doc ~S"""
  Provides an `if/2` macro.

  This macro expects the first argument to be a condition and the second
  argument to be a keyword list.

  ## One-liner examples

      if(foo, do: bar)

  In the example above, `bar` will be returned if `foo` evaluates to
  a truthy value (neither `false` nor `nil`). Otherwise, `nil` will be
  returned.

  An `else` option can be given to specify the opposite:

      if(foo, do: bar, else: baz)

  ## Blocks examples

  It's also possible to pass a block to the `if/2` macro. The first
  example above would be translated to:

      if foo do
        bar
      end

  Note that `do/end` become delimiters. The second example would
  translate to:

      if foo do
        bar
      else
        baz
      end

  In order to compare more than two clauses, the `cond/1` macro has to be used.

  """
  defmacro if(condition, clauses) do
    build_if(condition, clauses)
  end

  @doc ~S"""
  Membership operator. Checks if the element on the left-hand side is a member of the
  collection on the right-hand side.

  ## Examples

      iex> x = 1
      iex> x in [1, 2, 3]
      true

  This operator (which is a macro) simply translates to a call to
  `Enum.member?/2`. The example above would translate to:

      Enum.member?([1, 2, 3], x)

  Elixir also supports `left not in right`, which evaluates to
  `not(left in right)`:

      iex> x = 1
      iex> x not in [1, 2, 3]
      false

  ## Guards

  The `in/2` operator (as well as `not in`) can be used in guard clauses as
  long as the right-hand side is a range or a list. In such cases, Elixir will
  expand the operator to a valid guard expression. For example:

      when x in [1, 2, 3]

  translates to:

      when x === 1 or x === 2 or x === 3

  When using ranges:

      when x in 1..3

  translates to:

      when is_integer(x) and x >= 1 and x <= 3

  Note that only integers can be considered inside a range by `in`.

  ### AST considerations

  `left not in right` is parsed by the compiler into the AST:

      {:not, _, [{:in, _, [left, right]}]}

  This is the same AST as `not(left in right)`.

  Additionally, `Macro.to_string/2` will translate all occurrences of
  this AST to `left not in right`.

  module name like `ArgumentError` or `RuntimeError`) passing `attrs` as the
  attributes in order to retrieve the exception struct.

  Any module that contains a call to the `defexception/1` macro automatically
  implements the `c:Exception.exception/1` callback expected by `raise/2`.
  For more information, see `defexception/1`.

  ## Examples

  Uses the given module in the current context.

  When calling:

      use MyModule, some: :options

  the `__using__/1` macro from the `MyModule` module is invoked with the second
  argument passed to `use` as its argument. Since `__using__/1` is a macro, all
  the usual macro rules apply, and its return value should be quoted code
  that is then inserted where `use/2` is called.

  ## Examples

  For example, to write test cases using the `ExUnit` framework provided
  with Elixir, a developer should `use` the `ExUnit.Case` module:

      defmodule AssertionTest do
        use ExUnit.Case, async: true

        test "always pass" do
          assert true
        end
      end

  In this example, Elixir will call the `__using__/1` macro in the
  `ExUnit.Case` module with the keyword list `[async: true]` as its
  argument.

  In other words, `use/2` translates to:

      defmodule AssertionTest do
        require ExUnit.Case
        ExUnit.Case.__using__(async: true)

        test "always pass" do
          assert true
        end
      end

  where `ExUnit.Case` defines the `__using__/1` macro:

      defmodule ExUnit.Case do
        defmacro __using__(opts) do
          # do something with opts
          quote do
            # return some code to inject in the caller
          end
        end
      end

  ## Best practices

  `__using__/1` is typically used when there is a need to set some state (via
  module attributes) or callbacks (like `@before_compile`, see the documentation
  for `Module` for more information) into the caller.

  `__using__/1` may also be used to alias, require, or import functionality
  from different modules:

      defmodule MyModule do
        defmacro __using__(_opts) do
          quote do
            import MyModule.Foo
            import MyModule.Bar
            import MyModule.Baz

            alias MyModule.Repo
          end
        end
      end

  However, do not provide `__using__/1` if all it does is to import,
  alias or require the module itself. For example, avoid this:

      defmodule MyModule do
        defmacro __using__(_opts) do
          quote do
            import MyModule
          end
        end
      end

  In such cases, developers should instead import or alias the module
  directly, so that they can customize those as they wish,
  without the indirection behind `use/2`.

  Finally, developers should also avoid defining functions inside
  the `__using__/1` callback, unless those functions are the default
  implementation of a previously defined `@callback` or are functions
  meant to be overridden (see `defoverridable/1`). Even in these cases,
  defining functions should be seen as a "last resort".

  In case you want to provide some existing functionality to the user module,
  please define it in a module which will be imported accordingly; for example,
  `ExUnit.Case` doesn't define the `test/3` macro in the module that calls
  `use ExUnit.Case`, but it defines `ExUnit.Case.test/3` and just imports that
  into the caller when used.

  Pipe operator.

  This operator introduces the expression on the left-hand side as
  the first argument to the function call on the right-hand side.

  ## Examples

      iex> [1, [2], 3] |> List.flatten()
      [1, 2, 3]

  The example above is the same as calling `List.flatten([1, [2], 3])`.

  The `|>` operator is mostly useful when there is a desire to execute a series
  of operations resembling a pipeline:

      iex> [1, [2], 3] |> List.flatten() |> Enum.map(fn x -> x * 2 end)
      [2, 4, 6]

  In the example above, the list `[1, [2], 3]` is passed as the first argument
  to the `List.flatten/1` function, then the flattened list is passed as the
  first argument to the `Enum.map/2` function which doubles each element of the
  list.

  In other words, the expression above simply translates to:

      Enum.map(List.flatten([1, [2], 3]), fn x -> x * 2 end)

  ## Pitfalls

  There are two common pitfalls when using the pipe operator.

  The first one is related to operator precedence. For example,
  the following expression:

      String.graphemes "Hello" |> Enum.reverse

  Translates to:

      String.graphemes("Hello" |> Enum.reverse())

  which results in an error as the `Enumerable` protocol is not defined
  for binaries. Adding explicit parentheses resolves the ambiguity:

      String.graphemes("Hello") |> Enum.reverse()

  Or, even better:

      "Hello" |> String.graphemes() |> Enum.reverse()

  The second pitfall is that the `|>` operator works on calls.
  For example, when you write:

      "Hello" |> some_function()

  Elixir sees the right-hand side is a function call and pipes
  to it. This means that, if you want to pipe to an anonymous
  or captured function, it must also be explicitly called.

  Given the anonymous function:

      fun = fn x -> IO.puts(x) end
      fun.("Hello")

  This won't work as it will rather try to invoke the local
  function `fun`:

      "Hello" |> fun()

  This works:

      "Hello" |> fun.()

  As you can see, the `|>` operator retains the same semantics
  as when the pipe is not used since both require the `fun.(...)`
  notation.

  Boolean "or" operator.

  List subtraction operator. Removes the first occurrence of an element on the left list
  for each element on the right.

  Before Erlang/OTP 22, the complexity of `a -- b` was proportional to
  `length(a) * length(b)`, meaning that it would be very slow if
  both `a` and `b` were long lists. In such cases, consider
  converting each list to a `MapSet` and using `MapSet.difference/2`.

  As of Erlang/OTP 22, this operation is significantly faster even if both
  lists are very long, and using `--/2` is usually faster and uses less
  memory than using the `MapSet`-based alternative mentioned above.

  Stops the execution of the calling process with the given reason.

  Since evaluating this function causes the process to terminate,
  it has no return value.

  Inlined by the compiler.

  ## Examples

  When a process reaches its end, by default it exits with
  reason `:normal`. You can also call `exit/1` explicitly if you
  want to terminate a process but not signal any failure:

      exit(:normal)

  In case something goes wrong, you can also use `exit/1` with
  a different reason:

      exit(:seems_bad)

  If the exit reason is not `:normal`, all the processes linked to the process
  that exited will crash (unless they are trapping exits).

  ## OTP exits

  Exits are used by the OTP to determine if a process exited abnormally
  or not. The following exits are considered "normal":

    * `exit(:normal)`
    * `exit(:shutdown)`
    * `exit({:shutdown, term})`

  Exiting with any other reason is considered abnormal and treated
  as a crash. This means the default supervisor behaviour kicks in,
  error reports are emitted, and so forth.

  This behaviour is relied on in many different places. For example,
  `ExUnit` uses `exit(:shutdown)` when exiting the test process to
  signal linked processes, supervision trees and so on to politely
  shut down too.

  ## CLI exits

  Building on top of the exit signals mentioned above, if the
  process started by the command line exits with any of the three
  reasons above, its exit is considered normal and the Operating
  System process will exit with status 0.

  It is, however, possible to customize the operating system exit
  signal by invoking:

      exit({:shutdown, integer})

  This will cause the operating system process to exit with the status given by
  `integer` while signaling all linked Erlang processes to politely
  shut down.

  Any other exit reason will cause the operating system process to exit with
  status `1` and linked Erlang processes to crash.

  Gets a value and updates a nested structure.

  `data` is a nested structure (that is, a map, keyword
  list, or struct that implements the `Access` behaviour).

  The `fun` argument receives the value of `key` (or `nil` if `key`
  is not present) and must return one of the following values:

    * a two-element tuple `{get_value, new_value}`. In this case,
      `get_value` is the retrieved value which can possibly be operated on before
      being returned. `new_value` is the new value to be stored under `key`.

    * `:pop`, which implies that the current value under `key`
      should be removed from the structure and returned.

  This function uses the `Access` module to traverse the structures
  according to the given `keys`, unless the `key` is a function,
  which is detailed in a later section.

  ## Examples

  This function is useful when there is a need to retrieve the current
  value (or something calculated in function of the current value) and
  update it at the same time. For example, it could be used to read the
  current age of a user while increasing it by one in one pass:

      iex> users = %{"john" => %{age: 27}, "meg" => %{age: 23}}
      iex> get_and_update_in(users, ["john", :age], &{&1, &1 + 1})
      {27, %{"john" => %{age: 28}, "meg" => %{age: 23}}}

  ## Functions as keys

  If a key is a function, the function will be invoked passing three
  arguments:

    * the operation (`:get_and_update`)
    * the data to be accessed
    * a function to be invoked next

  This means `get_and_update_in/3` can be extended to provide custom
  lookups. The downside is that functions cannot be stored as keys
  in the accessed data structures.

  When one of the keys is a function, the function is invoked.
  In the example below, we use a function to get and increment all
  ages inside a list:

      iex> users = [%{name: "john", age: 27}, %{name: "meg", age: 23}]
      iex> all = fn :get_and_update, data, next ->
      ...>   data |> Enum.map(next) |> Enum.unzip()
      ...> end
      iex> get_and_update_in(users, [all, :age], &{&1, &1 + 1})
      {[27, 23], [%{name: "john", age: 28}, %{name: "meg", age: 24}]}

  If the previous value before invoking the function is `nil`,
  the function *will* receive `nil` as a value and must handle it
  accordingly (be it by failing or providing a sane default).

  The `Access` module ships with many convenience accessor functions,
  like the `all` anonymous function defined above. See `Access.all/0`,
  `Access.key/2`, and others as examples.

      iex> get_in(users, ["unknown", :age])
      nil

  ## Functions as keys

  If a key is a function, the function will be invoked passing three
  arguments:

    * the operation (`:get`)
    * the data to be accessed
    * a function to be invoked next

  This means `get_in/2` can be extended to provide custom lookups.
  In the example below, we use a function to get all the maps inside
  a list:

      iex> users = [%{name: "john", age: 27}, %{name: "meg", age: 23}]
      iex> all = fn :get, data, next -> Enum.map(data, next) end
      iex> get_in(users, [all, :age])
      [27, 23]

  If the previous value before invoking the function is `nil`,
  the function *will* receive `nil` as a value and must handle it
  accordingly.

  The `Access` module ships with many convenience accessor functions,
  like the `all` anonymous function defined above. See `Access.all/0`,
  `Access.key/2`, and others as examples.

  Inspects the given argument according to the `Inspect` protocol.
  The second argument is a keyword list with options to control
  inspection.

  ## Options

  `inspect/2` accepts a list of options that are internally
  translated to an `Inspect.Opts` struct. Check the docs for
  `Inspect.Opts` to see the supported options.

  ## Examples

      iex> inspect(:foo)
      ":foo"

      iex> inspect([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], limit: 3)
      "[1, 2, 3, ...]"

      iex> inspect([1, 2, 3], pretty: true, width: 0)
      "[1,\n 2,\n 3]"

      iex> inspect("olá" <> <<0>>)

      iex> inspect("olá" <> <<0>>, binaries: :as_strings)
      "\"olá\\0\""

      iex> inspect("olá", binaries: :as_binaries)
      "<<111, 108, 195, 161>>"

      iex> inspect('bar')
      "'bar'"

      iex> inspect([0 | 'bar'])
      "[0, 98, 97, 114]"

      iex> inspect(100, base: :octal)
      "0o144"

      iex> inspect(100, base: :hex)
      "0x64"

  Note that the `Inspect` protocol does not necessarily return a valid
  representation of an Elixir term. In such cases, the inspected result
  must start with `#`. For example, inspecting a function will return:

      inspect(fn a, b -> a + b end)
      #=> #Function<...>

  The `Inspect` protocol can be derived to hide certain fields
  from structs, so they don't show up in logs, inspects and similar.

  protocol for more information.

  Creates and updates a struct.

  The `struct` argument may be an atom (which defines `defstruct`)
  or a `struct` itself. The second argument is any `Enumerable` that
  emits two-element tuples (key-value pairs) during enumeration.

  Keys in the `Enumerable` that don't exist in the struct are automatically
  discarded. Note that keys must be atoms, as only atoms are allowed when
  defining a struct. If keys in the `Enumerable` are duplicated, the last
  entry will be taken (same behaviour as `Map.new/1`).

  This function is useful for dynamically creating and updating structs, as
  well as for converting maps to structs; in the latter case, just inserting
  the appropriate `:__struct__` field into the map may not be enough and
  `struct/2` should be used instead.

    * when building a struct, as in `struct!(SomeStruct, key: :value)`,
      it is equivalent to `%SomeStruct{key: :value}` and therefore this
      function will check if every given key-value belongs to the struct.
      If the struct is enforcing any key via `@enforce_keys`, those will
      be enforced as well;

    * when updating a struct, as in `struct!(%SomeStruct{}, key: :value)`,
      it is equivalent to `%SomeStruct{struct | key: :value}` and therefore this
      function will check if every given key-value belongs to the struct.
      However, updating structs does not enforce keys, as keys are enforced
      only when building;

  Updates a key in a nested structure.

  Uses the `Access` module to traverse the structures
  according to the given `keys`, unless the `key` is a
  function. If the key is a function, it will be invoked
  as specified in `get_and_update_in/3`.

  `data` is a nested structure (that is, a map, keyword
  list, or struct that implements the `Access` behaviour).
  The `fun` argument receives the value of `key` (or `nil`
  if `key` is not present) and the result replaces the value
  in the structure.

  ## Examples

      iex> users = %{"john" => %{age: 27}, "meg" => %{age: 23}}
      iex> update_in(users, ["john", :age], &(&1 + 1))
      %{"john" => %{age: 28}, "meg" => %{age: 23}}

  In case any of the entries in the middle returns `nil`,
  an error will be raised when trying to access it next.
