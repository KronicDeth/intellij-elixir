/**
 * Runs [block] directly if off-EDT (or if [skipModalIf] returns `true`), otherwise wraps it in
 * [runWithModalProgressBlocking] so the EDT is not blocked.
 *
 * Use [skipModalIf] when the modal progress dialog must not be shown - for example, when a write
 * action is already held on the EDT (`ApplicationManager.getApplication().isWriteAccessAllowed`),
 * because starting modal progress from inside a write action would deadlock.
 *
 * Use this to guard any blocking subprocess or I/O call that may be triggered from the EDT.
 *
 * It does NOT drop read access. Called from inside the platform's own read action,
 * [runWithModalProgressBlocking] grants the modal computation a read permit rather than releasing
 * the caller's, so a callee guarding with `check(!holdsReadLock())` still throws, and there is no
 * supported way to opt out. Launch lock-sensitive I/O on a service coroutine scope instead (#3955).
