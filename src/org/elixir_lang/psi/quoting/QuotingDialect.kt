/**
 * Which shape of quoted form to emit, as a threshold on the Elixir version that produced it.
 *
 * Elixir's quoted form changes between versions, so a single answer is wrong for every version but
 * one. Each constant marks a version at which a divergence appeared; the predicates below read as
 * "this dialect is at least that version", so a dialect answers every predicate for every earlier
 * constant too.
 *
 * All the divergences known so far are **additive** - a newer Elixir emits metadata, or a richer
 * node, where an older one emitted less - which is exactly what a monotonic threshold expresses.
 * Adding a version therefore costs one constant and one predicate. Should a future Elixir *remove*
 * something instead, a monotonic threshold can no longer express it and this becomes a hierarchy;
 * likewise if a divergence ever needs different *construction* rather than a different *decision*.
 *
 * Every threshold here was pinned against Elixir's own history and confirmed by quoting the
 * construct with the reference implementation on either side of the boundary - see each constant.
