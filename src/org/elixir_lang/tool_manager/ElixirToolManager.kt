/**
 * A tool manager that can resolve installed Elixir/Erlang versions for a project directory.
 *
 * Implementations (mise, asdf, …) must:
 * - Return `null` from [resolveVersions] when the manager is not applicable for the given
 *   directory (not installed, no config file, transient subprocess failure, etc.).
 * - Return [ToolManagerResult.Error] when the manager is applicable but encountered an
 *   actionable error.  The implementation is responsible for providing a human-readable
 *   [ToolManagerResult.Error.description] that explains the problem and how to fix it.
 * - Return [ToolManagerResult.Success] when versions were successfully resolved.
 * - Be stateless with respect to the project; all context is provided through [resolveVersions].
 *
 * [name] is the **stable persistence key** written to `elixir.xml` via [ToolManagerSettings].
 * Do not change it after the first release that ships this tool manager.
