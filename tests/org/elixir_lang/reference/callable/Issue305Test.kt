/**
 * https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/305
 *
 * A macro's arguments are quoted, so in a match they can bind - `session(id, user) = raw` declares
 * both `id` and `user`, the way `Record.defrecord`'s generated accessors are used to destructure an
 * Erlang record. A function's arguments are values and bind nothing. The two are indistinguishable
 * syntactically, so deciding between them means resolving the call and asking whether it is a
 * `defmacro`.
 *
 * Asserted through the real Ctrl+Click gesture rather than [com.intellij.psi.PsiPolyVariantReference.multiResolve],
 * because the gesture has three outcomes where `multiResolve` has one bit: navigating to the
 * declaration, offering Show Usages (the caret is *on* a declaration), and doing nothing. Reading
 * only "did it resolve" cannot tell the second from the first, which is exactly the confusion this
 * issue invites.
