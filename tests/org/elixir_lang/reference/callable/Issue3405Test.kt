     * A `for` comprehension generating ExUnit `test` calls puts `ex_unit.Case.isChild` and
     * `For.treeWalkDown` on the same walk: deciding whether a generated `test` is an `ExUnit.Case`
     * child resolves that call, and resolving it walks back up into the `for` and down into its
     * children again.
     *
     * Neither hinge's `hasBeenVisited` guard closes this. Both read a `ResolveState`, and the
     * reference boundary between them - `PsiPolyVariantReference.multiResolve` - carries none, so
     * the far side re-enters at `call_definition_clause.MultiResolve.resolveResults` and starts from
     * `ResolveState.initial()`. Seeding that fresh state with the entrance is enough while the `for`
     * body holds one generated `test`; with two, the walk reaches the sibling, which is on no
     * visited set, and the cycle closes. The reporter's file had two.
     *
     * What contains it is the element-keyed `RecursionManager` guard on
     * `reference.resolver.Callable.resolveInScope`, which is scoped to the thread's stack rather
     * than to a `ResolveState` and so survives that boundary. Removing it puts this fixture back on
     * the reported errors.
     *
     * The plugin catches its own overflow and reports it through
     * [org.elixir_lang.errorreport.Logger], so termination is asserted on what was logged rather
     * than on a `StackOverflowError` reaching the test.
