/**
 * https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/1613
 *
 * Cmd-Click on a usage of a function declared by `defdelegate` navigated nowhere, while the same
 * gesture on a `def` worked. Both halves are asserted because the report is a comparison between
 * them, and a `def` regression would otherwise read as this issue returning.
 *
 * The gesture and [PsiPolyVariantReference.multiResolve] disagree here and both are pinned: the
 * scope walk offers two valid results (the `defdelegate` head and the `to:` module's `def`), while
 * Go To Declaration navigates to the `def` alone. Asserting only the gesture would leave the
 * `defdelegate` head - the element the reporter asked to reach - unpinned.
