/**
 * Behavioural characterisation of *variable* completion: drives the real completion popup at the
 * caret (as a user would) and asserts the exact lookup set, rather than reaching through
 * `element.reference.variants`.
 *
 * The key guarantee pinned here is **dedup of rebound / shadowed bindings**: a variable that is
 * bound more than once (rebinding in the same scope, or shadowing across nested scopes) must appear
 * exactly once in completion. This locks the multi-binding collapse behaviour (`Callable.getVariants`
 * feeding `psi/scope/variable`) that a resolver refactor could silently regress into duplicate
 * lookup entries.
