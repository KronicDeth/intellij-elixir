 * quoter's own three, and emits their warnings. The daemon needs none of them at runtime.
 *

 * [quoterReleaseExecutablePath] derives the launcher location from the same value that
 * [mixEnvironment] hands to the child process, so the directory the build looks in cannot drift from
 * the one mix writes. Before this was pinned, an ambient MIX_ENV was enough to separate them - Gradle's
 * `environment(Map)` adds to the inherited environment rather than replacing it, so `MIX_ENV=test` in a
 * shell reached `mix release`, which still exited 0, so the availability marker recorded a daemon that
 * `startQuoter` then could not find.
 *
 * An explicit ambient MIX_ENV still wins, so a contributor can build the quoter in another environment
 * without editing the build; the path follows it.

 * (`<MIX_HOME>/elixir/1-15/`), for two reasons. That namespacing is not universal - Elixir 1.13 writes
 * `rebar3` to the root - so the pairs are not reliably isolated from each other. And a shared MIX_HOME
