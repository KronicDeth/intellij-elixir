## v11.5.0
### Enhancements
* [#1630](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1630) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Ignore the `incompleteCode` flag and instead always use the criteria used when `incompleteCode` was set.  

    | name prefix | exact name | ResolveResult | valid |
    |-------------|------------|---------------|-------|
    | ❌           | N/A        | ❌             | N/A   |
    | ✅           | ❌          | ✅             | ❌     |
    | ✅           | ✅          | ✅             | ✅     |

    This extends #1617 to more cases.
    * Qualified calls (`Process.flag(...)`, etc)
    * Type specs (`@spec foo(...)`)
    * Aliases (`alias Foo...`)
    * Module Attributes (`@attribute`)
    * Variables (`foo`)
    * `Protocol` reserved module attributes (`@protocol` and `@for`)

### Bug Fixes
* [#1650](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1650) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Fix debugger evaluator for Elixir >= 1.9.2. Ports [elixir-lang/elixir@7002554](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/commit/7002554a478f4c99dc4b63786a13cc7dca67799d).

## v11.4.0
### Enhancements
* [#1617](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1617) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Previously, the arity of a function or macro could only disagree with the definition and resolve if

  1. The arity of the call was in the arity range of the defintion and the `ResolveResult` was marked as a `validResult`.
  2. The code is marked as `incomplete` (because the IDE detects typing, etc) and the arity mismatches and the `ResolveResult` is marked as an invalid result.

  By marking all arity mismatches, regardless of incompleteness of the code as an invalid result, Go To Definition and Show Parameters works when the the arity is incorrect.  This males Show Parameters work while typing out a call without the correct number of commas and allows jumping to the definition while typing out the call too.

## v11.3.0
### Enhancements
* [#1600](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1600) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Show Parameter Info (⌘+P/Ctrl+P)

### Bug Fixes
* [#1607](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1607) - [@hoodaly](https://github.com/hoodaly)
  * Fix must specify non-empty 'commandLine' parameter
* [#1608](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1608) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `GeneralCommandLine`'s escaping for Windows can't handle the parentheses in a way that both works for the Windows shell and Elixir running the code the shell hands off.  Removing the parentheses leaves runnable code even if it is no longer formatted.  
  
     Fixes "Unknown Version" naming for Elixir SDKs and the "Probably SDK installed in ... is corrupt" dialog from appearing.

## v11.2.0
### Enhancements
* [#1592](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1592) - [@alex-dukhno](https://github.com/alex-dukhno)
  * Add `ExUnit` `describe` block template.

### Bug Fixes
* [#1589](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1589) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Don't error on `runtume` in mix deps.  `guardian` is too common of a dependency and too many users have the version with the typo installed.
* [#1569](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1569) - [@chitacan](https://github.com/chitacan)
  * Fix IEx Mix Run/Debug Configuration for `asdf` by using absolute path to `mix`.
* [#1595](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1595) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Add OTP 22 and 23 opcodes to Code BEAM Chunk Viewer
    * `put_tuple/2`
    * `bs_get_tail/3`
    * `bs_start_match3/4`
    * `bs_get_position/3`
    * `bs_set_position/2`
    * `swap/2`

## v11.1.0
### Enhancements
* [#1587](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1587) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Update gradle plugins
    * `gradle-intellij-plugin` (`org.jetbrains.intellij`) to `0.4.10`
    * `org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm` to `1.3.50`
    * `de.undercrouch.download` to `4.0.0`
  * Update IDEA version in builds
    * `2019.2` -> `2019.2.2`

### Bug Fixes
* [#1582](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1582) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Don't log if partial or no header typeID is read.  It happens too often due to `.beam` files being written partially to disk during the build process.  They will be re-indexed when they are complete.
* [#1587](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1587) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Update gradle intellij plugin to fix `runIde` on newer macOS.
* [#1588](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1588) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Fix `ConcurrentModificationException` in Structure View

    Java 9 fixed a bug (https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8071667) in `HashMap` where `computeIfAbsent` did not check for concurrent modifications, and it turns out that `TreeElementList` was using concurrent modifications, so it was now broke.

    Fixed by use `get` or `put` if it is absent, so that `putNew` can ensure that the `CallDefinition` is in the `TreeElementList` before it is added to the `MutableList<TreeElement>`, which was the original reason why there was a `put` inside of `computeIfAbsent`, which would have `put` when the function returned anyway.

## v11.0.1
### Bug Fixes
* [#1548](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1545) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * The java plugin dependency needs to be declared so that it shows up for compiling the JPS builder system and the project importer in IntelliJ and Android Studio, but it needs to be optional, so that the plugin is still compatible with Rubymine and the other small IDEs.

## v11.0.0
### Enhancements
* [#1545](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1545) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Simplifications due to only supporting IntelliJ 2019.2
    * Don't use reflection for error report Submitter
    * Don't use deprecated WeakHashMap. It was needed for backwards compatibility, but since this build is for 2019.2 only, no compatibility is necessary and it clears up the long warnings from the logs for end users.
    *  Remove reflection from OutputToGeneralTestEventsConverters.  Only 2019.2 is now supported, so no need for complicated backwards compatibility.
    * Only support IntelliJ 2019.2 in Travis CI
  * Remove Elixir 1.5 and 1.6 builds as they are both > 1 year since the last release approximately.
  
### Bug Fixes
* [#1545](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1545) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * IntelliJ 2019.2 compatibility
     * Explicitly depend on java plugin.  2019.2 extracted the Java functionality to a plugin (as outlined [here](https://blog.jetbrains.com/platform/2019/06/java-functionality-extracted-as-a-plugin/)), which includes the JPS builder used for Project Build functionality.
    *  Remove project converterts.  Project converters are broken in 2019.2 because the `DialogWrapper` they try to launch isn't being launched in the Event Dispatch Thread (EDT) (https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-218071).
  
       As this is bug in code wholey controlled by upstream, the only option is to remove the project converters.  The work-around is for users to re-import projects when a project layout update is necessary.
    *  Fix nullability of `override` arguments in `ChooseByNameModel`
    *  Don't use dependency injection for OpenProcessor builder.  JetBrains has removed dependency injection for Extensions in 2019.2.
    * Don't pass a null name ot findSdk

### Incompatible Changes
* [#1545](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1545) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Changes needed for 2019.2 compatibility make this build incompatible with earlier releases.

## v10.6.0

### Enhancements
* [#1492](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1492) - Add Linux Mint Erlang and Elixir home paths to SDK home path suggestions.  Linux Mint installs to `/usr/lib/erlang` and `/usr/lib/elixir` instead of `/usr/local/lib/erlang` and `/usr/local/lib/elixir`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

### Bug Fixes
* [#1491](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1491) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Elixir 1.8 made `:elixir.quoted_to_erl/3` private, so in Elixir 1.8+, the debugger needs to inline the private version to maintain < 1.8 and >= 1.8 compatibility.
  * Reformat debugger for Elixir 1.8

## v10.5.1

### Bug Fixes
* [#1483](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1483) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Numerous users have reported that annotation can encounter a `StackOverflowError`.  [A reproduction case](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/1475#issuecomment-491616192) shows that they are called by Phoenix `Web` modules where one function containing `quote` block `use`s the same module again, such as an `admin_view` depending on the base `view` through `use App.Web, :view`.  When the `use App.Web, :view` is resolving, the `defmacro __using__` is re-entered as is the `admin_view` because there was no tracking of already visited `PsiElement`s.  The fix is to track the visited elements and not re-enter the visited elements so that `admin_view` is skipped and the other call definition clauses can be checked to find `view`.

## v10.5.0

### Enhancements
* [#1445](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1445) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Replace comparator with Comparator.reverseOrder()
  * The correct home path for `kiex` is `~/.kiex/elixirs/elixir-VERSION/lib/elixir` as that contains the true `lib` and `bin` directory, but users may select other directories by mistake, so doing the following adjustments:
    * Adjust `bin` home path to `lib/elixir`.
    * Adjust `elixirs/elixir-VERSION` home path to `elixirs/elixir-VERSION/lib/elixir`.
* [#1462](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1462) - Use reflections to allow saving settings when creating the projects before in 2018.3 and 2019.1 even though the API changed. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

### Bug Fixes
* [#1443](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1443) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * In RubyMine, attach OTP applications as separate projects with Elixir facets instead of directly creating `ELIXIR_MODULE` modules in `DirectoryConfigurator`.  This matches the manual steps of opening the OTP apps as separate directories after opening the root of the project.
    * Mark directories when adding facet
    * Sync libraries when adding facet or attaching to root project.  Ensures External Libraries show up for all OTP applications.
  * Convert Small IDE projects with `ELIXIR_MODULE`s:
     1. Remove `ELIXIR_MODULE` `*.iml` files
     2. Remove `ELIXIR_MODULE` entries root project's `modules.xml` file.
     3. [Lack of modules in project in `doOpenProject`](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/1f49fc455d01f4b887463853db48e814f6700fb3/platform/platform-impl/src/com/intellij/platform/PlatformProjectOpenProcessor.java#L186-L188) will trigger `DirectoryProjectConfigurator`s to be [run](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/blob/1f49fc455d01f4b887463853db48e814f6700fb3/platform/platform-impl/src/com/intellij/platform/PlatformProjectOpenProcessor.java#L206), which will setup the project and run `DirectoryConfigurator` to attach the `apps` OTP apps and Elixir facets.
        * Only support automatic attaching multiple OTP apps as separate projects in Rubymine.  In IntelliJ normal support for multiple Modules in one Project still works.
* [#1444](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1444) - Increase suspect `nameSet` size to `15` to support [`geo`](https://hex.pm/packages/geo).  `geo` has [13 `String.Chars` implementations](https://hexdocs.pm/geo/3.1.0/api-reference.html). - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1445](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1445) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Remove obsolete `SdkType`.  I keep confusing it with its replacement `org.elixir_lang.sdk.elixir.Type`!
  * Check that HomePath has `ebin` paths when validation.  Prevents selecting false HomePaths for `kiex`.
* [#1446](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1446) - Adding missing ESpec template.  When reviewing #1410 I missed that the template wasn't in `resources`. 🤦‍♂️ - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1447](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1447) - Ignore `targets` when calculating `Dep` path. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1448](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1448) - Ignore `organization` when calculating `Dep` path. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1449](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1449) - Get view provider document in read action. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1450](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1450) - Support `rebar.config` deps that are name only. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1456](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1456) - Always use `containingFile` for `QualifiableAlias` `maxScope` for `getReference`.  Prevents cache capturing `maxScope`, which can vary based on invocation. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1462](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1462) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Create new project before attaching it in Small IDEs.
    When attaching a directory to a project during startup, saving is disallowed, so the attached directory only has a `workspace.xml` in its `.idea` when the attach is attempted.  Attaching requires the `.idea/*.iml` Module file, so the attaching fails, saying the directory is an unsupported format.

    Experimentation showed that manually attaching the directory also did not work, but opening the directory in a separate window, then opening and attaching it again would make the directory have the full project files.  To mimic this manual process:

    1. The internals of `doOpenProject` are copied
    2. A save of the project files is forced, bypassing the normal "startup" save blocker
    3. The project is attached to the root project.

    Tested to work when upgrading from 10.4.0 to 10.5.0-pre in Rubymine when no project was already open.
  *  Check if project can be attached instead of if RubyMine
     Although GoLand supports attaching projects, it doesn't work for non-Go projects, so it is also excluded.  How the support appears in each non-IntelliJ IDEA is shown below:

     | IDE            | Works? |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

     | Android Studio | YES    | Android Studio is built on top of IntelliJ, so it has full multi-Module support.  It is not Small IDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

     | GoLand         | NO     | Modules show up, but independent projects are not attached as in other Small IDEs, so disabled.  In general, the Go settings, like Test Runners always win, so it is recommended to not use GoLand at all for Elixir development.                                                                                                                                  |

### Bug Fixes
* [#1408](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1408) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Cache all computed Elixir levels at the file, module, project, and SDK levels.  The computed Elixir level is used to determine how to emulate the various grammar changes made for the different Elixir versions.  This bug was potentially introduced as earlier as[v7.0.0]() (2017-12-15) and as late as [v7.5.0](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/releases/tag/v7.5.0) (2018-06-03) as that's [the history for `LevelPropertyPusher.java`](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/commits/da149f8430cd378e964ae5a53a127754b3a00bc9/src/org/elixir_lang/file/LevelPropertyPusher.java) and has affected all later versions.  If you ever experienced the 6.X series as faster than the 7.X series and later, this bug may be why and you should upgrade/reinstall immediately.

## v10.2.0

### Enhancements
* [#1353](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1353) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Improve support for umbrella projects in Small IDEs like Rubymine by creating a separate module for each `mix.exs` when opening a directory (`DirectoryConfigurator`).  This matches the pre-existing support in Rich IDEs (IntelliJ Community & Ultimate Edition) when using Import From External Model and Quick Import when opening a directory.
  * Ignore `assets` directory when looking for `mix.exs` files for Import From External Model, Quick Import and Directory Configurator.

* [#1364](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1364) - Use `:path` for deps for paths external to project.  Unfortunately, even though they show up in the Project Structure, only `ebin` directories are shown as it is restricted to those marked as `CLASSES` and the `:path` `lib` is a `SOURCES`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

     * `use ExUnit.Case`
     * `alias` of the source module
     * `@moduletag :capture_log`
     * `doctest`
     * `test` that checks that the source module exists.
  * Convert `CreateElixirModuleAction` to Kotlin.

## v10.0.1

### Bug Fixes
* [#1322](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1322) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Eliminate freezes when calculating Module and Library dependencies during project import and dependency updates.
    * Run library syncing in tasks: When importing projects, run sync as a modal task while when `VirtualFileSystem` events occur, run sync as background tasks.  Either style of task is cancellable and importantly, it allows to show what is happening during the syncing.  This converts the unresponsive UI beachball on macOS during import to an updating progress bar.
    * Calculate dep sets iteratively with a work queue instead of recursively to limit the calculation of dep set for a root to 1 time.  Then use normal transitive walk to get complete dep set for module.  Vastly speeds up project import.
    * Cache dep set on package `PsiFile` to allow faster refreshes when indirect dependencies don't change.
* [#1323](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1323) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Log `nameSet` when it reaches suspect size (`10`) to allow triaging if it is a real bug or just something with a lot of valid names.
  * Fix inverted condition around when to warn and when to error and use `readAheadLength`.

## v10.0.0

### Enhancements
* [#1272](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1272) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Go To Symbol and completion will only resolve in project source unless non-project sources are turned on.
    * `deps` are properly marked as Libraries and no longer count as being in the project scope for the Go To tools.
    * In umbrella projects, when `in_umbrella` is used, the Project Module for each `apps/#{APP_NAME}` will be marked a dependency,
    * Library and Modules are properly connected as dependencies, so that only declared dependencies will resolve, lessening false completions and declarations when different OTP app share common Module or function names.
  * `deps` and the `_build/#{MIX_ENV}/lib/#{DEP_NAME}` will be marked as Excluded, so that Libraries appear in External Libraries at the bottom of the Project Pane.
* [#1275](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1275) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Go To Class action (Cmd+O) to go to modules separately from all functions as would happen with Go To Symbols (Alt+Cmd+O).
    * New ModuleName index keeps track of only the names of modulars:
      * defmodule
      * defimpl
      * defprotocol

      It is used to power gotoClassContributor for Go To Class action.

* [#1285](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1285) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Resolve unaliased name when using `alias __MODULE__, as: Mod`
  * Resolve usage of `Mod` in `alias __MODULE__, as Mod`
    1. `Mod`
    2. `__MODULE__` in `alias __MODULE__`
    3. `defmodule MyModule` that is enclosing `__MODULE__`.
  * Disable `ProcessCanceledException` for `runIde` gradle task, to allow for easier manual testing of completion and Go To actions during development.
  * Completion of functions in current module when using `Mod.` after `alias __MODULE__, as: Mod`.
  * Show more context for `alias` calls in presentations, like "Choose Declaration" pop up for Go To Declaration.
    * Show resolved `__MODULE__` name (`alias MyModule`) when using `alias __MODULE__`.
    * Show full `alias MyModule, as: Mod` when listing `Mod` in `alias __MODULE__, as Mod`.

  * More closely match [ExUnit.CliFormatter](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v1.7.3/lib/ex_unit/lib/ex_unit/cli_formatter.ex) output in Test Runner.
    * Don't `inspect` ExUnit failure `reason` as `##teamcity` `message`.
    * Add captured logs to failure
    * Colorize test failures - including diff colorization
  * `.formatter.exs` input globs would not match file paths because it was default that needed `lib` on top and not version-dependent paths used in `resources/exunit`.
* [#1291](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1291) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Ignore branch and hex options when finding path of Mix.Dep
  * Map Elixir 1.7 `:excluded` and `:skipped` (added in [elixir-lang/elixir#7245](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/7245)) to `testIgnored` teamcity message, thereby restoring ignored test counts and markers from Elixir 1.6.
* [#1293](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1293) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * When the entire deps directory has updated sync the children deps directories and then sync all modules instead of syncing them after each dep.
  *  For an unknown reason, when sync occurs at `initComponent` time in `DepsWatcher` or `mix.Watcher`, the child directories of the project `basedDir` aren't shown in the Project Pane until a change is applied in Project Structure.
  * Use `invokeAndWait` instead of `invokeLater` to ensure order of syncs.
* [#1299](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1299) - When finding a `defmodule`, check that it is an ancestor of the entrance of the `ResolveState`, so that nested sibling modules are not scanned for potential call definition clauses, but only the outer module of the entrance. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1300](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1300) - Improve error message for `org.elixir_lang.debugger.settings.stepping.module_filter.editor.table.Model.getValueAt`, so we can detect if there is an off-by-1 error. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#1305](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1305) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Fix unused variables in `TeamCityExUnitFormatting`
    * `reason` was completely unused.
    * `details` should have been used.
* [#1306](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1306) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `flushBufferBeforeTerminating` was deprecated and in newer IntelliJ the call to `processStatuses` does not occur unless `flushBufferOnProcessTermination` is also overridden.
  * Treat `== Compilation error` in `STDOUT` as `ERROR` for ExUnit reporter
  * Convert `(CompileError)` of a test file to test failure.  The "Test framework quit unexpectedly" is converted to a failed run with a single test with the compilation error as the failure message.
* [#1308](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1308) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Don't treat redefinition of `defmodule` macro as module definition (as occurs in [@bitwalker](https://github.com/bitwalker)'s [distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery)'s `Mix.Tasks.Release.Init.MixMock`
    * Bump `AllName` `VERSION` to re-index and drop bad call definition head from [#1301](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/1301).
* [#1310](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1310) - Don't log compilation errors as test failures unless a test has started.   Test name being called `mix test` does not work, so log those compilation errors as normal build messages instead. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1311](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1311) - Don't interpret `:crypto` by default: `:crypto` includes NIFs that can't be reloaded and so kills the debugger. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1312](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1312) - Protect from `null` `containingFile` for modular names during completion. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1313](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1313) - Wrap `syncPublisher(JDK_TABLE_TOPIC)` in `invokeLater` `runWriteAction`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

### Incompatible Changes
* [#1272](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1272) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Dependencies are now counted as external to the project, so the Go To tools, like Go To Symbol will no longer include matches for both project sources and dependencies sources together, instead they will follow the more JetBrains native behavior
    * Project sources will be shown by default
    *  If there are no project matches, dependencies will be shown instead.
    * If you want to include dependency (non-project) matches, you can check the box or hit Cmd+O.
* [#1293](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1293) - Modules and Libraries won't be automatically setup when a project or module is opened, but instead only when `apps` or `deps` directories or subdirectories change. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v9.0.0

### Enhancements
* [#1255](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1255) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Resolve calls through `use AnAlias` calls
    1. `AnAlias` will be resolved to its modular (module, implementation, or protocol)
    2. The `__using__` macro in the modular is found
    3. The last call in `__using__` is checked
      * If it is a `quote` block, check for call definitions recursively inside the block
      * If it is an `apply/3` call
        1. Resolve the first argument as a modular
        2. Scan for each function in `modular`
        3. In each function Goto Step 3 above

        This handling is what specifically makes `use MyAppWeb, :controller` in Phoenix apps now work.
      * If it is a general call
        1. Resolve the call to its definition
        2. Goto Step 3 above
* [#1259](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1259) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Go To Related (`Ctrl+Cmd+Up`) can be used to Go To the decompiled Module or call definitions when on a source modular (`defimpl`, `defmodule`, or `defprotocol`) or callable (`def`, `defp`, `defmacro`, `defmacrop`).  This somewhat restores the ability to go to both source and decompiled module and calls before 9.0.0, but now the source is preferred for Go To Declaration and the decompiled will only be available if there is no source and if you definitely want decompiled, you'll need to use Go To Related.

### Bug Fixes
* [#1245](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1245) - Specify that Kotlin Plugin is needed in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, so IntelliJ plays nice. - [@sfat](https://github.com/sfat)
* [#1246](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1246) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Resolve unqualified bracket operation identifiers (`var` in `var[key]`) to variables or `0`-arity calls.
    * Fixes renames of variables not renaming usage of variables for Access lookups (i.e. `var[key]`).
* [#1248](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1248) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Go To Symbol will no longer show redundant entries
    * Call Definitions (`name/arity`) is no longer shown if the Call Definition Clause is also included.  This isn't a large loss because the `/arity` was not searchable and only part of the presentation.
    * If there is a decompiled and a source version of a symbol, only the source version will be shown.
      * The source Implementation will be shown and not the decompiled Module with the same fully-qualified name (`<protocol>.<for>`).
    * Items will be deduped if they point to the same element, such as function clauses with default arguments because when presented they look the same even if internally one is representing `/1` and `/2`, for example.
* [#1249](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1249) - Ensure that Go To Declaration for qualified calls such as `Module.function(...)` where `Module` is an alias does not return the decompiled version of `Module` when the source is available. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1256](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1256) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Fix completion not working for unqualified functions from `import`s.
    * When I switched to using `?.let` I accidentally hid the `if` from running when there was no `ENTRANCE_CALL_DEFINITION_CLAUSE`, so the correct form is add if there is no entrance or if there is a non-equivalent entrance.
    *  I just straight up forgot an ! on a contains check. I moved to computeIfAbsent, so it is more obvious what the intent is.

### Incompatible Changs
* [#1248](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1248) Go To Symbol and Go To Declaration will no longer suggest decompiled modules or functions if source modules or functions of the same name or module/name/arity exists. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

### Enhancements
* [#1226](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1226) - Flat icons to match [IntelliJ IDEA 2018.2 design rules](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2018/06/26/new-icons-in-intellij-platform-2018-2/).

* [#1234](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1234) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Add Facet SDK as External Library to re-enable indexing.  When the External Library was removed in [4297287](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/commit/42972876c219e9da7283513bc5677e5121b5e0fe) in favor of a real SDK, completion for SDK `.beam` modules was lost because Small IDEs don't index SDKs, but only External Libraries, so add Application-wide External Libraries for SDKs when they are created (and update, remove on edit or delete), which are then added as a Dependency for the facet's module when the SDK is set for the Small IDE project.
    * Convert old modules with Elixir facets to also have External Library, so that users don't need to remove and add the SDKs to get the External Library.
* [#1237](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1237) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Use #AEB9C0 for JetBrains Default/Light Gray.  Use #87939A for JetBrains Darcula Gray.  Colors based on IntelliJ's color picker picking its own colors.

    Icon matching testing done under both themes in 2018.2.1.  Weirdly, the colors are different in the SVGs in my intellij-community@master.  Hopefully, this doesn't mean the colors change again in 2018.3.
* [#1244](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1244) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Run `createLibrary` inside `runWriteAction`.
  * Remove test that leaks threads and so causes builds to fail.

        * Adding configuration-specific filters
        * Remove configuration-specific filters
      * Allow interpreted modules to be uninterpreted when the debugger is running, using the "Interpreted Modules" tab.
    * Improved Variables pane by showing the Elixir name of variables instead of Erlang names
    * Evaluate can evaluate an Elixir expression in any stack frame.

* [#1208](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1208) - `TerminalExecutionConsole` itself echos input in `2018.2` and `2018.2.1`, which was introduced in https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community/commit/fd7bbd0cb7f3c2a5add8872e0e6c5172be5f074a#diff-5acc2eb2e78fe52d7458d4a48b0eac9f, but it was reverted in JetBrains/intellij-community@5f4465b, so this uses that version to maintain compatibility across supported versions. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#1215](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1215) - In `eachEbinPath`, the ebin directories were found by iterating `<SDK_HOME_PATH>/lib` and then iterating grandchild of that, so that all paths matching `<SDK_HOME_PATH>/lib/<APP>/ebin` would be added, but for some installs from source, like SDK, there are non-OTP-app files in `<SDK_HOME_PATH>/lib`, so filter `<SDK_HOME_PATH>/lib/<APP>` to only directories. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1216](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1216) - `org.elixir.lang.psi.scope.Module.aliasedName(QualifiedAlias)` was already converted to use `org.elixir_lang.psi.operation.Normalized` and `org.elixir_lang.psi.infix.Normalized`, which makes it work with errors in the PSI tree, so there's no need protect with an assert and that assert would be wrong in times of errors handled by `Normalized`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1217](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1217) - `org.elixir_lang.reference.module.UnaliasedName.down(PsiElement)` only expects `ElixirAccessExpression` or `QualifiableAlias`, but for unexpected classes of elements, it was a simple Kotlin `TODO()`, which didn't log anything useful for enhancements.

  * Read Write Accessor Detector
    * Variable/Parameter declarations/rebindings are highlighted as writes while other usages are highlighted as reads.
  * Improved Find & Show Usages
    * Added Find & Show Usages for Functions at declaration and usage site
      * Multi-clause functions use all clauses as targets and find usages of all clauses.
    * Improved Find & Show Usages for Modules/Aliases
  * Improved Element Descriptions
    * It is easier to distinguish `alias`es and the `defmodule` that is being aliased because element description now include `alias` or `defmodule` before the Alias name based on how the Alias is defined in the scope.
    * Call definitions use the same presentation for Structure View and Find Usages, so that Compile/Runtime time icons, and visibility are the same in both.

    * `mix format` debugger
    * Restructure debugger.
    * Convert IDE-side to Kotlin
  * Allow files to skip interpreting in the debugger to be configured in Preferences > Build, Execution, Deployment > Debugger > Stepping.  It is recommended to customize these settings instead of using `INTELLIJ_ELIXIR_DEBUG_BLACKLIST` environment variable.  `INTELLIJ_ELIXIR_DEBUG_BLACKLIST` should be reserved to additional modules that need to not be interpreted only for specific runs.
    * Ship a set of patterns that excludes Elixir standard library by default and most `mix phx.new` dependencies, so that debugger boots faster for most users.
  * Support debugging `.eex` templates
    * Detect MFAs that refer to template functions in Phoenix view modules derived from `.eex` template files, to allow stepping through Elixir tags in those templates.
    * Allow setting breakpoints in `.eex` files when a `.beam` file using the template's relative can be found.  **This means that the Phoenix view module `.beam` file must exist in `_build` prior to setting a breakpoint.  Run the Run Configuration once, before debugging to complete the build if setting a breakpoint does not work.**
      * `.beam` files are now indexed by their `Line` chunk `filenames` subsection to power this feature.
  * Cache `.beam` `Beam` `Cache` on `VirtualFile`.  Cache is invalidated and refreshed on modification of the `VirtualFile`.  Cache is used for both BEAM Chunks read-only editors and `Line` chunk file name index.
* [#1037](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1037) - Each package manager uses a different root path and which directory to pick above the ebins varies by package manager, so document package manager install paths. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1041](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1041) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Restructure JPS code to remove  prefixes and suffixes in class names that redundant with package names.
  * Show warnings-as-errors checkbox as [original blocker](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/issues/3116#issuecomment-87316125) has been fixed for awhile and `ProcessAdapter` turns warning text into errors that IDE understands.
* [#1045](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1045) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * When importing Mix projects, don't exclude compiler output from indexing because it is needed to resolve Elixir Line Breakpoints in EEx files.
    * For pre-existing Elixir modules, they will be converted to not exclude compiler output.
* [#1047](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1047) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Exclude known uninterpretable modules
    * `Bcrypt.Base`
    * `:erocksdb`
    * `:lz4`
    * `:re2`

### Bug Fixes
* [#1036](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1036) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Turn off `dbeug` flag when starting `IntelliJElixir.DebugServer`, which removes the `*DBG*` statements that kept printing in the ExUnit output when using the debugger.
  * Fix conversion of Elixir module names to Erlang module names for `INTELLIJ_ELIXIR_DEBUG_BLACKLIST` environment variable.
  * Cache `null` SDK `Release`, so that when Elixir is configured, but the Erlang path is broken (such as after a `brew unlink erlang`, the `Release` calculating using `elixir`
  * Implement `Macro.atomToString`
  * Properly render improper lists
    * Show improper list with explicit `|` for presenation
    * Children of improper lists show `head` and `tail` instead of index.
  * Show Elixir indices (`0`-based) instead of Erlang indices (`1`-based`) for lists and tuples.
* [#1037](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1037) - Loosen check on the path suffix by looking for only `lib` and not `lib/erlang/lib`, so that it works for both Homebrew's `ebin` paths and ASDF's `ebin` paths. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#1041](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1041) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Remove unused `MixBuilder` because building with `mix` is just an option in `ElixirBuilder`.
  * Harmonize JPS compile server's invoking of `mix` to pattern used in Run Configuration runners.
    * Use `mix` path from SDK
  * No longer say the build succeeded when there are obvious `mix` errors
    * Parse `mix compile` output for compilation errors and warnings
      * When "warnings-as-errors" is enabled in "Elixir compiler" settings, IDE also shows warnings as errors.
      * IDE will know build failed if there are errors (or warnings treated as errors) and properly allow rebuild.
* [#1045](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1045) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Group alternatives in `erlang_module_name_patterns_to_regex` before pinning: I always forget that the `|` swallows the `^` and `$` in regexes.
  * Reject vs filter accumulation got flipped when switching to `Enum.reduce` to track rejections.
* [#1047](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1047) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Some modules, like NIF modules, can't be loaded into the debugger. Individual modules not being debuggable shouldn't kill the debugger task, so rescue the known error and record it for later debugging of the debugger.
  * Add `:` to start of Erlang module names for included debugger excludes

## v7.3.0

### Enhancements
* [#988](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/988) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Update build matrix
    * Update IntelliJ IDEA version `2017.3` to `2017.3.2`
    * Update Elixir version `1.5.2` to `1.5.3`
* [#1015](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/1015) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Add supplemental file editor for `.beam` files: "BEAM Chunks".  The decompiled binary file will continue to be shown on the default "Text" editor tab.
    ![screen shot 2018-02-01 at 6 38 07 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35710803-17198a52-077f-11e8-8991-2aebe7f3eb38.png)
    The BEAM Chunks editor is subdivided into further tabs, one for each chunk in the `.beam` file.
    ![screen shot 2018-02-01 at 6 45 23 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35710979-1d367930-0780-11e8-8a40-acaef92e621c.png)
    The tabs are listed in the order that the chunks occur in the `.beam` file.
    * The `Atom` chunk holds `LATIN-1` atoms while `AtU8` holds `UTF8` atoms.  There will only be one of these atom-related chunks in any given `.beam` file.  `AtU8` is used in newer versions of OTP that support UTF8 atoms.

      The `Atom`/`AtU8` tab shows a table with the columns

      | Column     | Description                                                                                                           | Source  |
      |:-----------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------|
      | Index      | Which is 1-based to match Erlang convention.  In the `Code` chunk, `atom(0)` is reserved to always translate to `nil` | Derived |
      | Byte Count | The byte count for the atom's bytes                                                                                   | Raw     |
      | Characters | From encoding the bytes as LATIN-1 for `Atom` chunk or UTF-8 for `AtU8` chunk                                         | Derived |

      ![screen shot 2018-02-01 at 7 01 43 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35711460-9aeea9ae-0782-11e8-9d3f-074c05326b4c.png)

      Index 1 is always the module name for the `.beam` file.  Since `.beam` is originally an Erlang format, for Elixir modules, you'll see the full atom name of with the `Elixir.` prefix instead of the Alias name used in Elixir source.
    * The `Attr` chunk holds the module attributes, but only those that are persisted.

      The `Attr` tab shows a table with the columns

      | Column | Description                                                                                                      | Source |
      |:-------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------|
      | Key    | Attribute name                                                                                                   | Raw    |
      | Value  | Attribute value. **Note: The value always appears as a list as read from the binary format.  I don't know why.** | Raw    |

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 2 34 22 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35753689-576eaf18-0826-11e8-838c-f00fc93fd667.png)

      All modules will have a `:vsn` attribute that is either set explicitly or defaults to the MD5 of the module.
    * The `CInf` chunk is the Compilation Information for the Erlang or Erlang Core compiler.  Even Elixir modules have it because Elixir code passes through this part of the Erlang Core compiler.

      The `CInf` tab shows a table with the columns

      | Column | Description     | Source |
      |:-------|:----------------|:-------|
      | Key    | Option name     | Raw    |
      | Value  | Inspected value | Raw    |

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 3 19 50 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35755542-4d769c76-082d-11e8-84d9-ef04ff45b346.png)
    * The `Code` chunk contains the byte code for the module.  It is encoded in [BEAM Compact Term Encoding](http://beam-wisdoms.clau.se/en/latest/indepth-beam-file.html#beam-compact-term-encoding), which differs from the binary format produced by `term_to_binary`.

      The `Code` tab shows a read-only editor with one byte code operation on each line.  For ease of reading, operations are grouped by function and then label block with indentation indicating scope.

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 9 35 59 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35762701-18b0882e-0861-11e8-9d3d-675811bd45dd.png)

      By default as many references to other chunks and references to other parts of `Code` chunk are inlined to ease understanding.  If you want to see the raw byte code operations, you can turn off the various inliners.
    * The `Dbgi` chunk contains Debug Info.  It was [introduced](https://github.com/erlang/otp/pull/1367) in OTP 20 as a replacement for the `Abst` chunk.  While the `Abst` chunk was required to contain the Erlang AST, the `Dbgi` format can contain the debug info for other languages, such as Elixir `quoted` form AST.

      Because the format is language neutral, the format is a set of nested, versioned formats.  The outer most layer is

      ```elixir
      {:debug_info_v1, backend, metadata | :none}
      ```

      For `:debug_info_v1`, Elixir's `backend` is `:elixir_erl`.  The `metadata` for `:elixir_erl` is further versioned: `{:elixir_v1, map, specs}`.

      `map` contains the bulk of the data.

      | Key             | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
      |:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | `:attributes`   | Attributes similar to the `Attr` chunk, but at the Elixir, instead of Core Erlang level.  Usually they match with the exception that `attributes` doesn't contain `vsn` when `Attr` contains the `MD5` version |
      | `:compile_opts` | Compilation options similar to `CInf` chunk's `options` key, but at for Elixir, instead of Core Erlang level.                                                                                                  |
      | `:definitions`  | The Elixir `quoted` AST for reach function clause.                                                                                                                                                             |
      | `:file`         | The name of the file the module was generated from.                                                                                                                                                            |
      | `:line`         | The line in `:file` where the module was defined, such as the line `defmodule` occurred.                                                                                                                       |
      | `:module`       | The name of the module as an `atom`                                                                                                                                                                            |
      | `:unreachable`  | Unreachable functions                                                                                                                                                                                          |

      The `Dbgi` tag show the single value map entries: `:file`, `:line`, and `:module`

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 5 26 04 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35759265-33c33742-083e-11e8-9a4f-97cfd52bbe8e.png)

      For the multi-value keys: `:attributes`, `:compile_opts`, and `:definitions`, there are individual tabs.

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 5 27 29 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35759293-6117c83e-083e-11e8-8327-ec7c66cade69.png)

      The Attributes tab has the same format as the `Attr`s chunk

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 6 47 49 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35760967-9c7e0914-0849-11e8-8d53-e402653b70fa.png)

      The Compile Options tab is usually empty, much like the `CInf` `options` key for Erlang.

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 6 48 34 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35760988-c3ef0f52-0849-11e8-9ca6-2cbeba8eda23.png)

      The Definitions tab is split between a tree of Module, Function/Arity and clauses.

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 6 50 14 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35761058-3710d04c-084a-11e8-99e3-0f2aa4f8837d.png)

      Clicking on a clause will show only that clause, but clicking on a higher level in the tree will show all clauses in the function or the entire Module.

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 6 53 17 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35761087-7a6e0b8e-084a-11e8-9f86-6e4840eab25d.png)

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 8 47 05 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35762314-55fb0dd2-085a-11e8-8381-faacc880d29e.png)

      ![screen shot 2018-02-02 at 8 47 20 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35762317-5b9f9136-085a-11e8-8b53-03be16b7a06c.png)

      The AST stored in the `definitions` tab and the process of converting it back to code is not format preserves, so it will not look precisely like the source code as the AST has undergone some macro expansion before its put in the Dbgi chunk.  *As common idioms are understood, reversals will be add to the renderer.*
    * The `ExDc` chunk stores ExDoc.  Not the rendered HTML from the `ex_doc` package, but the the `@doc`, `@moduledoc`, and `@typedoc` attribute values that work even without `ex_doc` installed.  This chunk is what is consulted when the `h` helper is used in `iex`.

      The `ExDc` binary format is from `term_to_binary`, so it can be reversed with `binary_to_term`.  The term format is a versioned as `{version, versioned_format}`.  The current `version` tag is `:elixir_docs_v1` and the `versioned_format` is a [Keyword.t](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Keyword.html#t:t/0) with `:callback_docs`, `:docs`, `:moduledoc`, and `:type_docs` keys.

      Like `Dbgi`, the `ExDc` tab is split between a tree to navigate and an editor to show the decompiled value.

      | Functions/Macros         | All `@doc`s for functions/macros   |
      | Functions/Macros *child* | A specific function/macro's `@doc` |

    * The `ExpT` chunk is the Export Table.  The name "Export" derives from the `Erlang` module attribute `-export`, which is used to "export" functions from a module.  It is the equivalent of making a function or macro public with `def` and `defmacro` as opposed to making it private with `defp` and `defmacrop` in Elixir.

      The `ExpT` tab shows a table with the columns

      | Column     | Description                                                                                                                                                                             | Source  |

      You'll notice the first entry starts with `MACRO-`.  This is because the BEAM, being made for Erlang has no concept of macros. It only understands functions, so Elixir macros, like `__using__/1` called by `use` are compiled to plain Erlang functions with `MACRO-` prefixed to their name and an extra argument (the `__CALLER__` environment) as the first argument, which increases the arity, yielding a full MFA of `MACRO-__using__/2` as seen above.

    * The `ImpT` chunk is the Import Table.  It **DOES NOT** encode just the Erlang `-import` attributes or Elixir `import` macro calls: it tracks any external function or macro called from another module.  `call_ext_*` operations in the `Code` chunk don't store the Module and Function (MF) of the function they will call directly in the bytecode, instead, one of the arguments is an index into the `ImpT` chunk.   This way, all external calls are normalized into the `ImpT` chunk instead of being denormalized to the call site.  The arity still appears at the call site to help with checking the argument count.

      The `ImpT` tab shows a table with the columns

      | Column              | Description                                                  | Source  |

      | Index               | 0-based index used by references in the `Code` chunk.        | Derived |
      | Module Atom Index   | Index into the `Atom` or `AtU8` chunk for the Module's name  | Raw     |
      | Module Atom         | The atom referenced by "Module Atom Index".                  | Derived |
      | Function Atom Index | Index into the `Atom` or `AtU8` chunk for the functon's name | Raw     |
      | Function Atom       | The atom referened by "Function Atom Index".                 | Derived |

      You may notice that `erlang.byte_size/1` is included in the table.  This is because even bifs are referenced by MFA and not a pre-assigned number as would be the case for system calls in operating systems like Linux.  BEAM is like an Operation System, but not in all ways.
    * The `LitT` chunk contains literals loaded as arguments in `Code` chunk.  Confusingly, in the `Code` chunk sometimes the `literal(N)` term is used to encode integer `N`, an index into another chunk, or an actual `index` into the `LitT`.  How `literal` terms are handled is completely dependent on the specific operation, so without having outside knowledge about the bytecode operation arguments for BEAM, the best way to figure out if `literal` terms are an integer or an index is to toggle the various controls in the `Code` tab to see if `literal` with no inlining turns into a `LitT` literal, `FunT` function reference, `ImpT` function reference, or integer.

      The `LitT` tab shows a table with the columns

      | Label      | Label index in the `Code` chunk where the function is defined. This label is usually immediately after the `func_info` operation and before the first pattern match or guard operation. | Raw     |

      You'll notice the first entry `-__struct__/1-fun-0-`, starts with `-` and have a `/` suffix with `fun` in it. This naming scheme is used for anonymous functions such as those defined with `fn` or the capture operator (`&`) in Elixir.  Much like how macros don't really exist and use a `MACRO-` suffix, anonymous functions/lambdas don't exist, and instead use a distinct naming scheme `-<PARENT_FUNCTION>/*fun*`.  Unlike `MACRO-`, which is an Elixir invention, anonymous functions/lambdas really being local named functions with derived names is also done in pure Erlang modules.  Erlang's anonymous functions are defined with `fun`, which is where the `fun` part of the naming scheme comes from.
    * The `StrT` chunk contains a single contiguous pool of all Erlang strings (that is, Elixir charlists) used in the `Code` chunk.  These strings are used for byte code operations like `bs_put_string`.  Not all strings appear in `StrT`.  Some strings, including most Elixir strings (Erlang binaries) appear in the `LitT` chunk that holds literals.

      ![screen shot 2018-02-01 at 7 56 15 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/298259/35712876-040796d8-078a-11e8-8eb6-6b7f203bbd4a.png)

      The `StrT` is contiguous with no separation of strings.  Instead of encoding the start and length of each string in the chunk itself, the start and length for any given string is passed as arguments to the byte code operations in the `Code` chunk. By doing this, shared substrings can be efficiently encoded in `StrT`.

  * Eliminate the majority of the `eolStar` parser rules around operators where they do not matter leaving only the `eolStar` after `COMMA` and the the ones that help differentiate unary and binary `+`/`-`.  This simplifies the parser and under certain conditions should prevent reparsing when only `WHITE_SPACE` changes in size.
    * Look-ahead in the lexer, where it's cheaper than the parser to see if the next token does not care if there's an `EOL` or normal `WHITE_SPACE`.
    * After operators that don't care if they are followed by `EOL`, try to match all following `WHITE_SPACE`, `ESCAPED_EOL` and `EOL`.

  * Remove `!stabOperationPrefix` before `expression`, since `stabOperationPrefix` itself starts with `expression` and instead put a negative look-ahead, `!(infixComma | stabInfixOperator)` after `expression`.  This now works when it previously didn't because `COMMA` was added to `expressionRecoverUntil`, which means both `COMMA` and `STAB_OPERATOR` are now in both not eaten by `expression`'s error recovery.

    This drops Fn1 through Fn8 to ~176ms instead of the previous time of the last optimization of 13 seconds for Fn8.  It started at 26 seconds and now it appears that the time no longer grows with the number of `fn`.  It also eliminates the pause when hitting entering inside the `fn` nesting.

  * EEx support
    * Lexer for EEx format
    * Parser for EEx format
    * EEx as a Template Language
      * Any file with `.eex` as the final extension will be treated as EEx.  To determine the Template Data Language, the `.eex` extension will be stripped and any remaining extension will be looked up to get the File Type and its associated Language.  For example, `*.txt.eex` will be EEx with Plain Text (`.txt`) as the Data Template Language.  Likewise, `*.html.eex` will be EEx with HTML as the Data Template Language.  There's no need to register `*.txt.eex` or `*.html.eex` or any other `*.DATA_TEMPLATE_LANGUAGE_EXTENSION.eex` pattern explicitly: the nested extension will be looked up using the normal extension setup.

  * Don't treat numeric operands to `@` and unary operators as separate operations from non-numeric operands to port elixir-lang/elixir@9747e58db773c716c01c210642ec1d91475e0c83 that shipped with Elixir 1.5.0.  This only kicks in if the Elixir SDK is version >= 1.5.0 or not set.  With an earlier SDK, you'll get the earlier behavior.

To fill this gap, if the SDK is not Elixir and a Small IDE is detected, then the SDK Home from Preferences > Other Settings > Elixir External Tools > Elixir SDK > Path will be used to get the absolute path to the `elixir` (or `elixir.bat` executable and set it in the `GeneralCommandLine`.

### Enhancements
* [#817](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/817) - * Add note to README that atom module names should be prefixed with `:` - [@merqlove](https://github.com/merglove)
* [#827](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/827) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Elixir SDK will now have an Internal Erlang SDK, which can be supplied one of two ways:
    1. If `intellij-erlang` is installed: its Erlang SDK can be used
    2. Otherwise: the Erlang SDK for Elixir SDK from this plugin can be used

    Either Internal Erlang SDK's home path is used to locate the `erl` (or `erl.exe` on Windows) executable and it is used to run Elixir; bypassing the `elixir` (or `elixir.bat` on Windows) script.  Instead, as was done in #789, the ebin directories for the Elixir SDK are passed as `-pa` options to `erl`.

    The Elixir SDK's configuration becomes more important: the classpath entries are now the list of `ebin` directories to pass to `erl` using `-pa` instead of scanning for ebins in the homepath, so additional code paths can be added to the Classpaths configuration and they will be used when running `mix` and `mix test`.  The classpaths will be initialized to the ebin directories under the home path.

    * To support migrating from earlier version of the plugin, an SDK will be updated when it is used for Mix ExUnit Run Configurations
      * The default Internal Erlang SDK will be set, which uses the latest version of Erlang that can be found on the system.  When `intellij-erlang` is installed, `intellij-elixir`'s Erlang version suggestion is still used because `intellij-elixir` favors the latest version while `intellij-erlang` favors the first found, which is usually the oldest version.
      * Update roots (class path, source paths, documentation paths):
        * Class path of `HOMEPATH/lib` is replaced with `HOMEPATH/lib/APP/ebin`.
        * Source path of `HOMEPATH/lib` is replaced with `HOMEPATH/lib/APP/lib` IF it exists (so only for source SDKs)
        * Documentation of `http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/` will be replaced with `https://hexdoc.pm/APP/VERSION` for every `APP` in `HOMEPATH/lib`.
* [#839](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/839) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * All `ebin` paths in the Internal Erlang SDK will be copied to the Elixir SDK, so that they are indexed, which makes the Internal Erlang SDK modules show up in Symbol search.
  * Erlang SDK modules can be completed and then functions in those modules can be completed after typing `.`.
    * Atoms have References.
      * Indexed atoms (from decompiled Erlang `.beams` from the Internal Erlang SDK) will be used for completing atoms as soon the atom is parseable: either after the first letter `:` or inside the quotes when making a quoted atom.
      * Atoms will resolve to modules if the atom is a module name.  If the atom is quoted and contains interpolation, it will treat each interpolation as `.*` and look for regex matches to this derived potential atom name.
  * Completions for functions after `.` will now work at the end of file.  Previously, completions only worked in the middle of a file, where the `.` could parse the next work an existing call, now if that parse doesn't work and the only thing after is a new line, it will still complete.
* [#830](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/830) - Auto test for mix test case runner will automatically run tests after a change is detected in the project files, which normally happens on save, which happens when losing focus on a changed editor tab by default. - [@nivanson](https://github.com/nivanson)

  * Only use "Macros" as first header in decompiled `.beam` files if `macro` is `defmacro`.  "Macros" header was being printed when there was only functions because the check when there was no `lastMacroNameArity` didn't care what the current `macroNameArity.macro` was.
  * When an `.erl` file has `-compile([compressed])`, it will be compiled normally, and then gzipped, so that the `.beam` will not contain the BEAM magic number `FOR1`, but instead the gzip magic number `0x1f` `0x8b`.  So, to properly handle normal and compressed, the decompiler needs to look-ahead 2-bytes and check the gzip magic number.  If the gzip magic number is detected, the InputStream will be passed through `GZIPInputStream` before the the normal decoding process.
* [#842](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/842) - When decompiling function and macro names from Erlang module, its possible for the name to contain `#` and they would be interpreted as comments.  Accepting those names in `Unquoted` wouldn't escape the `#` from being treated as a comment, so in addition to `unquote`ing the name, surround it in double quotes. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#848](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/848) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `AdditionalDataConfigurable` only copied the the Internal Erlang SDK Code Paths when the selection in the `ComboBox` was changed, which meant if the there was only one Erlang SDK or the user never changed the selection, the Code Paths were never copied.  To get the Code Paths copied when the Elixir SDK is first created and `setupSdkPaths` interface method is called
    1. All paths are set directly on the Elixir SDK as before
    2. The default Erlang SDK, which should be the one that was last created, is configured in `SdkAdditionalaData`
    3. The Code paths from the Erlang SDK are copied to the Elixir SDK
        1. If the the Erlang SDK is from intellij-elixir and does not have `ebin` directories for its Class Paths, then the Class Paths is expanded to Code Paths.
* [#851](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/851) - The Code Paths from the Internal Erlang SDK were not being copied from the default Erlang SDK to the Elixir SDK when the default Erlang SDK was set during `mix test` runs, which meant that the Elixir SDK would not upgrade correctly from 6.1.1 to 6.2.0 without the user deleting the Elixir SDK and recreating it. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * Since the process of requiring resource files is the same, `org.elixir_lang.ElixirModules` has static methods for copying resources out to a temporary directory and adding the `-r <temporary_path>` for one or more resource files to a new or existing ParametersList.  These are now shared for the Mix ExUnit and Debugger code paths.
  * Format class
    * `ElixirXDebugProcess`
    * `MixExUnitRunningState`

### Bug Fixes
* [#792](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/792) - The compiled `.beam` files were removed in 58e7d4a, which was before v5.1.0, but not all users had problems with using the debugger.  [#739](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/739) [persisted](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/739#issuecomment-322032123) (as reported by [@erikreedstrom](https://github.com/erikreedstrom)) when 6.0.0 was released; I retried reproducing on a clean VM and I got it.  I'm not sure why it worked for some people in prior releases since the `.beam` don't exist that were being copied, but now the debugger uses the same system of copying `.ex` files and requiring them with `-r` instead of copying `.beam` and using `-pa` to add the `ebin` directory.  Fix was verified local under macOS and in Windows VM that reproduced [#739](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/issues/739). - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * Treat `::` the same as `:`  in `key:` after `when` in type specifications as it's a realistic error.
  * Change `.` to `#` when referring to constants in javadocs
  * Remove `@param` without descriptions
  * Remove explicit type from generics when the type can be inferred.
  * Check if `atNonNumericOperation` reference is non-`null` before resolving
  * Swap empty branches to inverted conditions for final `else`.
  * Check if `Type` `leftOperand` is `null` before using it.
  * Remove empty `highlightTypesAndTypeParameterUsages(When...)`
  * Remove unused `highlightTypesAndSpecificationTypeParameterDeclarations`
  * Flip `equals` to eliminate need for `null` check
  * Remove redundant type arguments (`<...>`)
  * Change `Collections.EMPTY_SET` to `Collections.emptySet()` to prevent uncheck cast warnings.
  * Inline constant argument for errors.
  * Check if `when` `rightOperand` is non-`null` before scanning it for parameter names.

  * When compilation error is detected during `mix test`, it will be turned into a test failure.
    * Compilation errors are any stacktraces to `stderr` that end in `    (elixir) lib/kernel/parallel_require.ex:`.
    * The test failure for the compilation will be attributed to either `mix test` or the inferred module name of test file.
      * If the first line of the stacktrace contains `test/.*_test.exs:\d+: \(module\)`
        * The file and line from that line will be used as the location of failure
        * The `test/` and `.exs` will be stripped from the file and it will be camelized to produce the derived test module name of the failure
      * Otherwise, `mix test` is used
  * Rearrange doc test names to emphasize the function being tested: `"test doc at MODULE.FUNCTION/ARITY (COUNT)"` becomes `"MODULE.FUNCTION/ARITY doc (COUNT)"`
    * If `MODULE` is the same as the test case without the `Test` suffix, then `MODULE.` is stripped too and the test name becomes only `FUNCTION/ARITY doc (COUNT)`
  * Fix parallel test cases nesting under each other due to asynchronous reporting from formatter.  `##teamCity` `testSuiteStarted` messages automatically nest, so switched to using `nodeId` and `parentNodeId` system, so that nesting is explicit.  This will allow multiple parallel tests to show up in GUI too.
  * `Elixir.` prefix is stripped from test case names.

  * Merge `Callable` and `Kernel` annotators
  * Use `PsiElementVisitor` instead of `PsiRecursiveElementVisitor`, so that macros in `defmodule` block don't get double annotated.
  * Instead of erasing and then applying multiple `TextAttributeKey`, erase as before, but then merge the `TextAttributeKey`'s `TextAttributes` and apply as single `setEnforcedTextAttributes`.  For some reason, this fixes the inconsistency of whether `PREDEFINED_CALL` or `MACRO_CALL` is applied first.

    * Highlight only stacktrace path and line umber instead of entire line
    * Better path match in stacktraces
      * Only accept VirtualFile if it has a suffix matching the stacktrace's path instead of accepting the first index file with a matching basename.

    The `|` is inside group that is then `{3}`'d, so it allows either `'` or `"` in groups of three.  This is only applies to the sigils.  It's correct for normal string and charlist heredocs:

  * Ignore `JFLex` jar
  * Don't check for `elixir-lang/elixr` files remove in `1.3`
  * Allow `nil` as a keyword key.  `nil` was being lexed as a potential keyword key, but NIL was missing from the token list in the keywordKey grammar rule.
* [#599](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/599) - Some SpecialForms don't work as literals as they would be interpreted as metaprogramming, so their name needs to be wrapped as an atom to `unquote`. -  [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * Skip `import Kernel` in `kernel.ex` to prevent stack overflow due to recursive `import`
  * Strip all outer parentheses for left type operand, so that `(+value)` can be see as `+` operator type spec.
  * Use advice from `IndexNotReadyException` documentation and check `DumbService.isDumb(Project)` before calling `StubIndex.getElements` in `Module` and `module.MultiResolve.indexNameElements`.
  * Don't `assert` that `LookupElement#getPsiElement` is not `null` in `CallDefinitionCluase.renderElement`
  * Update to `ant` `1.10.1` because `1.10.0` is no longer hosted.
* [#612](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/612) - Yeah, it sounds weird, but an `ElixirVariable` isn't necessarily a variable if it doesn't occur in a declaration context.  It could just be a no-parentheses function call in the wrong spot, so check the parent `PsiElement` to determine if `ElixirVariable` is a variable. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#614](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/614) - Highlight parameterized type head (`maybe(t)` in `@type maybe(t)`) the same as a full type definition (`maybe(t)` in `@type maybe(t) :: t | nil`) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

The `resolved` may be outside the file if it is a cross-file function or macro usage, in which case it's `TextRange` should not be highlighted because it is referring to offsets in a different file. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#634](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/634) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `Variable` scope for `QualifiedMultipleAliases`, which occurs when qualified call occurs over a line with assignment to a tuple, such as `Qualifier.\n{:ok, value} = call()`
  * Remove call definition clauses (function or macro) completion for bare words as it had a detrimental impact on typing feedback (the editor still took input, but it wasn't rendered until the completion returned OR `ESC` was hit to cancel the completion, which became excessive once the index of call definition clauses was expanded by the decompilation of the Elixir standard library `.beam`s, so disable it.  If bare-words completion is restored.  It will either (1) need to not use the `Reference#getVariants()` API because it generates too many objects that need to be thrown away or (2) need to only complete call definition clauses that are provably in-scope from imports or other macros.

  * The run configurations I put together in [#504](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/504) didn't allow for the debugger to work properly: neither pause nor breakpoints had any effect, so regenerate them from the Gradle pane.
  * Check parent of `when` operation in case it's a guarded function head in `org.elixir_lang.annonator.Parameter.putParameterized(Parameter, PsiElement)`
  * Instead of highlighting call definition clauses when they are referred to, which only works if it is in the same file, highlight all function and macro declarations when the `def*` call is encountered.
  * Only increment arity for right pipe operand instead of all operands, so that left operands resolve to correct arity or as variable/parameter.
* [#662](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/662) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Override `ModuleImpl#getProject()` to prevent `StackOverflowError`.  Without overriding `#getProject()`, `IdentifierHighlighterPass` gets stuck in a loop between `getManager` and `getProject` on the target (the `ModuleImpl`) when clicking on the space between `def`s or `defmacro`s in the decompiled `.beam` files.
  * Fix source formatting
  * Skip looking for variables unless 0-arity AND no arguments
  * Highlight unresolved macros as macro calls. Anything with a do keyword or a do block will be treated like a macro call even if it can't be resolved.  No resolved is either no resolve results or an empty list
  * Implicit imports at top of file in addition to top of Module.
* [#663](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/663) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `CallDefinitionClause` completion provider is unexpectedly invoked both when `.` is typed, but continues to be invoked after a letter is typed after the `.`; however, once the letter is typed, the letter becomes the default prefix instead, so the prefix should only be reset to `""` when it ends in `.`.
  * Disable `Callable#getVariants` unless `Unqualified` to  prevents local functions and macros being shown as completions for qualified names.

### Incompatible Changes
* [#585](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/585) - Move `^^^` to its own three-operator precedence level to match `1.2`.

## v4.7.0

### Enhancements
* [#523](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/523) - Use the `CommonProgramParametersPanel` to get the working directory and environment variables the same way the JUnit form does.  Replace the custom "Command" input with the "Program arguments" input built into the `CommonProgramParametersPanel`. `CommonProgramParametersPanel` expects to store the "Program Arguments" in a "ProgramParameters" field, so old run configurations will lose their "Command" option value and it will be migrated to the new "ProgramParameters". - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#537](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/537) - Convert `CallDefinitionClause(Call)` to `CallDefinitionClause.fromCall(Call)`, so that `null` can be returned when `CallDefinitionClause.enclosingModular(Call)` returns `null`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#539](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/539) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Use `functionName` instead of `getName` when multiresolving unqualified functions because `getName` will return the Alias when called on `defmodule`.
  * `maybeQualifiedCallToModular` returned `null` BOTH (1) if the call was unqualified OR (2) if the call was qualified, but its modular could not be resolved, so qualified calls to `.beam`-only modules, like `File.read!` returned `null` because `File` could not be resolved to a modular.  Remove `maybeqQualifiedToModular` and call `qualifiedToModular` when `myElement` is qualified.  If the modular is `null`, then return an empty `ResolveResult[]` instead of looking for unqualified matches.
  * Pass `maxScope` to `Module` reference.  `maxScope` is generally the containing file for the element, but when using `Module` to resolve `import`s, it is the `import` call's parent element, so that the resolve doesn't ricochet between the `defmodule` and its child, the `import` call until `StackOverflowError`.
* [#545](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/545) - A variable cannot be declared in update arguments, so return `LocalSearchScope.EMPTY`, the same as interpolation. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#548](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/548) - `ElixirSystemUtil.getProcessOutput` already allowed for an empty, invalid `ProcessOutput` when the `workDir` wasn't a directory, so allow it to also be `null` and return the empty `ProcessOutput`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#549](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/549) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * If a single keyword pair is used for a type spec, treat `:` as a type for `::`
  * Limit variable use scope for variables "declared" in module attributes to the module attribute because the variable can't be declared there and it is really a variable usage without declaration.

  * Go To Declaration for functions and macros (only those defined in parseable-Elixir source.  References to Erlang functions or only those available in `.beam` file, such as the standard library will not resolve.)
  * Completion for functions and macros (only those defined in parseable-Elixir source.  Erlang functions and Elixir function only in compiled `.beam` file, such as the standard library will not complete.)
    * Completion uses the same presentation as Structure View, so the you can tell whether the name is a function/macro, whether it is public/private, and the Module where it is defined.
    * Completed functions/macro insert `()` after the name in preparation for Elixir 1.4 where it is an error to have bare function calls.  It also makes it more obvious that you inserted a function and not a variable.
    * Completion works for all functions when a bare identifier is used.  For a qualified identifier, only functions/macros under than Module are shown.

### Bug Fixes
* [#419](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/419) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Return empty `Set` instead of `null` from `canonicalNameSet`
  * Highlight types in `ElixirMapUpdateArguments` even though they are an [invalid typespec example from elixir-lang/elixir tests](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/dadf98fbff2966f24bf5b0313822a90b90f7016a/lib/elixir/test/elixir/kernel/typespec_test.exs#L314-L320)
* [#424](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/424) - Check if `rightOperand` is `null` when highlighting types for `Type`, which can occur when typing `:` for an atom after the `::` for a `Type` - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#428](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/428) - Instead of asserting that a `QualifiableAlias` has 3 children, which may not be true on error recovery, use the `Normalized` static methods that are used elsewhere to handle error recovery around Infix operations as the `.` in `QualifiableAlias`es is a pseudo-Infix - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#441](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/441) - `isParameter(Call)` called `isParameter` on its parent if it wasn't a call definition clause, delegation or macro, but `isParameter(PsiElement)` immediately calls `getParent()` and does all the `instanceof` tests on the parent.  So, instead of `isParameter(Call)` calling `isParameter(PsiElement)` on its parent, it should just call it on itself, this way the check for `ElixirInterpolation` will not be skipped and there's no need to handle `ElixirInterpolatedString`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v4.3.0

### Enhancements
* [#387](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/387) - Resolve aliased modules to their `alias` call, from the alias call, you can Go To Declaration for the module itself. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Code structure
    * Module resolution uses the OpenAPI convention of `treeWalkUp` now instead of custom code.
    * Resolvable names has been extracted to its own class
  * Resolution use cases
    * `Suffix` resolves to `alias Prefix.Suffix`
    * `Suffix.Nested` resolves to `alias Prefix.Suffix`
    * `As` resolves `to `alias Prefix.Suffix, as: As`
    * `NestedSuffix` resolves to `alias __MODULE__.NestedSuffix`
* [#389](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/389) - Completion for module aliases - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
    * From in-file aliases
    * `__MODULE__`
    * In project modules (using index already used for Go To Declaration)
* [#393](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/393) - In addition to `StubBased#canonicalName`, there now also `StubBased#canonicalNames`, for when a call defines multiple canonical names, as is the case for `defimpl <PROTOCOL>, for: [<TYPE>, ...]`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#397](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/397) - When a aliased name is added to the module list for completion, it's unaliased name is searched for in the `AllName` index, if any nested modules are found for the unaliased name, then those nested names are aliased and also shown for completion. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#409](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/409) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Completion and reference tests for aliases:
    * `alias Prefix.Suffix`
    * `alias Prefix.Suffix, as: As`
    * `alias Prefix.{MultipleAliasA, MultipleAliasB}`

### Bug Fixes
* [#393](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/393) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * `defimpl <PROTOCOL>, for: [<TYPE>, ...]` generates multiple canonical names, which are stored in the stub index.
    * When retrieved from the `AllName` index, the `defimpl`'s Implementation will render as if only the `defimpl <PROTOCOL>, for: <TYPE>` was used for the `<TYPE>` matching the lookup name in the Goto Symbol dialog.  For example, if you search for `Tuple`, `JSX.Encoder.Tuple` will match for [`defimpl JSX.Encoder, for: for: [Tuple, PID, Port, Reference, Function, Any]`](https://github.com/talentdeficit/exjsx/blob/master/lib/jsx.ex#L152-L155).
* [#400](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/400) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Look outside Enum.map for enclosing macro call because `Ecto` defines the clauses of `__schema__(:type, ...)` using `Enum.map`, but `enclosingMacroCall` only knews to jump over enclosing macros like `for`, so a special case was added for anonymous function given to `Enum.map`.
  * Fix if-else-ordering bug where `Call` appeared before operations (which are usually `Call`s) like `Match`.
* [#401](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/401) - In `@type unquote({name, nil, []}) :: foo`, `name` will be highlighted as a type parameter even though it is not strictly the name that will appear as a type parameter. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#405](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/405) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Resolve alias nested under aliased modules to both the `alias` and `defmodule`, as resolving to only the `alias` loses the nested name, so it wasn't possible to jump to the nested name's `defmodule`.
  * Resolve aliased name to both the `alias` and the `defmodule`, so you can skip jumping to the `alias` before jumping to the `defmodule`.
* [#406](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/406) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * The generated `ElixirParser` uses the `GeneratedParserUtilBase` from `com.intellij.lang.parser`, but since that version is a synced copy, it is a snapshot of `GeneratedParserUtilBase` from the version of GrammarKit that was current when the IDE was released.  To ensure the generated parser works on all the IDEs, I copy `GeneratedParserUtilBase` from `org.intellij.grammar.parser` into `org.elixir_lang.grammar.parser` and then use that version in `ElixirParser`.  This ensures neither the IDE's version nor the version in any installed GrammarKit plugin is used.
* [#409](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/409) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Check that index name maps to an actual project element before returning it for completion as the names from `StubIndex.getInstance.getAllKeys(...)` is a superset of actual keys in the actual project [according to Peter Gromov of JetBrains](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/207930789-StubIndex-persisting-between-test-runs-leading-to-incorrect-completions).
  * Don't index `canonicalName` if it matches the literal name, as the duplicate name leads to duplicate entries in the completion lookup.
    * `canonicalNameCollection` was renamed to `canonicalNameSet` (with type changing from `Collection<String>` to `Set<String>` to match) to emphasize that the canonical names should be unique, but `canonicalNameSet` itself should still include duplicates of name for those places where only canonical names are used.
  * Use `resolvableName` for the `unaliasedName` for `MultipleAliases` Aliases, so that they complete correctly for nested modules.
  * Completion for nested modules will no longer complete with string suffixes (i.e. `SSHView`) and only complete nested Aliases (i.e. `SSH.Key`).

## v4.2.0

### Enhancements
* [#371](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/371) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * IntelliJ 15.0.4 is no longer available from JetBrains, so if the cache is not available, the builds don't work, so use 15.0.6, which is available in 15.0.4's place as the test version for 15.X.
  * IntelliJ 2016.2 is no longer available from JetBrains, so if the cache is not available, the builds don't work, so use 2016.2, which is available in 2016.1's places at the test version for 2016.X.
* [#378](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/378) - `enclosingMacroCall` could climb out the stab after a `do`, but not the `else` in an `if`, which is used for defined functions conditionally in [`Phoenix.Endpoint.server/0`](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix/blob/v1.2.0/lib/phoenix/endpoint.ex#L542-L548) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#380](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/380) - A lot of ppl use the doc template after already typing `@`, but the doc template starts with `@`, so it ends up inserting `@@doc ...`. The `@doc` template is the same code, but since the name starts with `@`, it doesn't insert a second `@`. Unfortunately, the template search code doesn't prompt when just typing `@`, so you end up having to type `@doc` before only one template is selected. The `@doc` template will show in the lookup as soon as `@d` is typed, but you have to select it from the list then before tabbing to accept. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#381](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/381) - Look at end of `do` instead of start for `end` completion to stop ignoring the `:` in `do: `, when `caret - 3` would land on the `o`, now all tests are meant to land on the `o`, so `do: ` won't complete with `end` incorrectly anymore. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

## v4.1.0

### Enhancements
* [#331](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/331) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Allow `do end` blocks to fold to `do: ...`
  * Allow `->` operator and the right operand to fold to `-> ...`
  * Allow `@doc`, `@moduledoc` and `@typedoc` value to fold to `"..."`.
  * Fold runs of adjacent `alias`, `import`, `require`, or `use` to be followed to a single `alias`, `import`, `require`, or `use` followed by `...`.
* [#334](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/334) - Function separators - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Show a function separator (Preferences > Editor > General > Appearance > Show method separators) above the group of `@doc`, `@spec` and `def`, `defp`, `defmacro`, and `defmacrop` (call definition clauses) of the same name and arity range.  Arity range will be used if one of the call definition clauses uses default arguments.
* [#337](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/337) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

* [#348](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/348) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Regenerate `gen` folder using Grammar Kit 1.4.1 and fix some bugs (including [JetBrains/Grammar-Kit#126](https://github.com/JetBrains/Grammar-Kit/issues/126)) manually.
* [#349](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/349) - Have both `QualifiedBracketOperation` and `UnqualifiedBracketOperation` extend `BracketOperation`, so that `BracketOperation` can be used to match both when the qualification does not matter. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#364](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/364) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Regenerate parser with GrammarKit 1.4.2
  * `ElixirSdkRelease` is now `Comparable`, so version checks can be done for tests to restrict them to Elixir 1.2+ for multiple alias support.
  * Resolve Multiple Aliases with unqualified Alias in tuples.
  * `canonicalName` borrows from the idea of `PsiReference#canonicalText`: an element can have both a Name (from `getName`), which is the literal name in the code, which can be renamed, and a Canonical Name, which is the name to refer to the element without need for imports or aliases.  For this change, `defimpl`, `defmodule`, and `defprotocol` will show their full module Alias for their Canonical Name.

    This change addresses the use case of Go To Declaration that should resolved to a nested `defmodule`.

  * Check all lines of output for mix version as Elixir 1.3.0 changed the format of `mix --version`, so that it includes the Erlang header (`Erlang/OTP ... [erts-...] [source] [64-bit] [smp:..:..] [async-threads:..] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]`) on the first line and `Mix <version>` on the 3rd line.

* [#344](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/344) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * If no known modular (Module, Implementation, Protocol, Quote, or Use) matches the call, then use Unknown, which accepts any macro with a `do` block or keyword.  This allows Go To Symbol to no error in projects using Dogma as `defrule` is now treated as Unknown instead of causing an error that the enclosing modular could not be found.

  * Ensure file reference highlight doesn't include the leading and trailing characters by fix off-by-one errors.
* [#358](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/358) - Determine whether to check left, right, or both by doing isAncestor checks for all operands, not just the normalized operand.  The normalized operand is still used for `PsiScopeProcessor#execute` since `#execute` is not expected to handle error elements. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

  * Add `A.{B, C}` to grammar with quoting to check consistence with Elixir 1.2.  Ports [elixir-lang/elixir#3666](https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/pull/3666).
  * Use `fullyQualifiedName` instead of `getName` for `resolvableName` because `fullyQualifiedName` is needed so that qualified aliases inside of the `{ }` of a multiple alias will not have a name as `getName` is `null` for those qualified aliases because the name from `getName` has to be a literal name that can be renamed and qualified names can't be renamed.
* [#365](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/365) - The `Module` icon got the same icon as `Unknown` when creating `Unknown` somehow, I assume due to find-replace. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)

    * Add Variable to Color Settings Page
    * Highlight bind quoted keyword key as Variable

    * Resolve variables from `destructure`
  * Detect bitstring segment options and don't treat them as variables.
    * Highlight bitstring segment type options as Type, the same highlight as used for `@type` names.
    * Don't generate (unresolved) references for bitstring segment options
  * Resolve `_` to only itself, no matter how many are used to reflect that it is non-binding, while `_<name>`  will resolve to `_<name>` as it does bind.
    * Add Ignored Variable to Color Settings Page
  * Reimplement module attribute renaming so that variable renaming can be implemented using a different validator for renaming (since module attribute names include the `@`).  Non-inplace renaming should also be supported, but inplace is preferred.  (There's a setting to turn off in-place renaming in JetBrains IDEs.)
  * `operation.infix.Normalized`
    * Normalizes leftOperand, operator, and rightOperand for an Infix operation that may have errors (in either operand).  If there is an error in the operand then its normalized value is `null`.
  * Keyword key type descriptions
    * Default to `"keyword key"`.
    * Detect `bind_quoted:` usage and call those `"quote bound variable"`.
  * Add interfaces to unify matching of `Matched` and `Unmatched` form of operations when the code cares about the operator
    * `And`
    * `UnaryNonNumericOperation`
  * Add `processDeclarations` to support variable and parameter resolution using `PsiTreeUtil.treeWalkUp` and `PsiScopeProcessors`
    * `ElixirStabBody`
    * StabOperations
  * Treat variables and parameters as `NamedElements`, so they can be Rename Refactored.

### Bug Fixes
* [#314](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/314) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Don't generate module attribute references for control attributes: Module attributes that control compilation or are predefined by the standard library: `@behaviour`, `@callback`, `@macrocallback`, `@doc`, `@moduledoc`, `@typedoc`, `@spec`, `@opaque`, `@type`, and `@typep`, should not have references because their uses are unrelated.
  * Drop requirement that there are 2 children and only require there be 1 and assume that is the Operator.
  * Don't count @(...) as a module attribute usage: Module attribute declarations are defined as `defmacro @(...)` in Kernel and that `@` should count as a function name, not a prefix for a module attribute name.
  * Allow `null` Module for Scratch File use scope
  * Default to `"call"` for Call type
  * Fix typo that had `*Two` operations using `Type` interface
  * Don't process `AccessExpression` declarations
* [#316](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/316) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Highlight `foo` in `@spec foo` as a type, which occurs while typing a new `@spec` before `::` can be typed.
  * Check if `leftOperand` is `null` even when `checkLeft` is `true` because `checkLeft` can be `true` and `leftOperand` is `null` when the `lastParent` is the operand or operation as a whole, but there is an error in the unnormalized `leftOperand` leading to the normalized `leftOperand` being `null`.
  * Check if reference is `null` before checking if it resolves to `null` when replacing module attribute usages with their value because `AtNonNumericOperation`s can have a `null` reference when they are non-referencing, like `@spec`.

* [#320](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/320) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Stab operation parameter Use Scope is the stab operation.
  * Skip over `PsiLeafElement` when looking for variables because the `PsiLeafElement` is an error.
  * In a script file where the parent of a `Match` is a `PsiFile`, the `Match` Use Scope is the rest of the file.
  * Add `=` to `Operator Signs`
  * Skip `NoParenthesesKeywords` when highlighting types, which occurs when the `::` has no proper right operand and the following one-liner function clause with `do:` is parsed as the right operand.
  * Skip `DUMMY_BLOCK` when looking for Variable, which prevents walking through errors.
  * Use `Normalized` pattern for `Prefix`, so that the operand is `null` when only the operator matches or the operand has errors.
  * Work-around Phoenix .ex templates that contain EEX: if `<%=` from EEX is detected, don't throw error when `Modular` can't be found.
  * Fix capitalization error in example text
* [#323](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/323) - Build `jps-builder` using only Java 1.6 compatible `.class`es - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * In IntelliJ 14.1, all of `openapi.jar` targets Java 1.6 (with `MAJOR.MINOR` `50.0`), but in IntelliJ 2016.1, some of `openapi.jar` targets only Java 1.8 (with `MAJOR.MINOR` `52.0`), since `jps-builders` require parts of `openapi.jar` and must target Java 1.6 even for IntelliJ 2016.1, the `52.0` `.class`es needed to be ported into `org.elixir_lang.jps.builder`, so that the `52.0` version in `openapi.jar` wouldn't be attempted to be loaded.

    This ended up being 5 classes:

    * `ExecutionException`
    * `GeneralCommandLine`
    * `ParametersList`
    * `ParamsGroup`
    * `ProcessNotCreatedException`

    Only `GeneralCommandLine` was used directly, all others are dependencies of it.

  * Changed `NotImplementedExceptions` and (some) `assert`s to logging custom error message that include the `PsiElement` text and the containing file as an attachment.  The files make the URL too big for the error handler to put the file contents in when opening the browser with the error handler, so the issue body instead explains how to get the attachment text out of IntelliJ's "IDE Fatal Errors"

* [#263](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/263) - Ensure compatibility from 14.0 to 2016.1 - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Use `TextAttributesKey`s that aren't deprecated in 2016.1 and work back to 14.1

    All of `CodeInsightColors` is deprecated, so all constants from there had to be replaced.  Unfortunately, the recommended replacements don't have the same color as the original, so I used different `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors` constants for some.

    "Module Attribute" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.CONSTANT` (which is purplish in Darcula) instead of the recommended `METADATA`, which is yellow.  Although module attributes don't have to be constant since they can be set to accumulate, often they are used as constants and not really as metadata, since they are just data then.  All the `metadata` uses of module attributes have a separate color.

    "Specification" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.FUNCTION_DECLARATION`, which maintains the golden color that `CodeInsightColors.METHOD_DECLARATION_ATTRIBUTES` had.

    "Type" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.METADATA`, which is bright yellow unlike `CodeInsightColors.ANNOTATION_ATTRIBUTE_NAME_ATTRIBUTES`, which was a bright white.

    "Type Parameter" is now based on `DefaultLanguageHighlighterColors.PARAMETER`, which unfortunately has no attributes associated with it, but the constant name was too good a fit not to use, so if you want the old color, you'll need to customize it yourself.

* [#272](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/272) - Fix (one cause) of `AssertionError` in `GoToSymbolContributor` when the `Modular` (`defimpl`, `demodule`, `defprotocol`, and `quote`) could not be resolved due a `def` being surrounded by a `for` comprehension, which is common in Elixir libraries as was the case for `Postgrex`: any enclosing `for` comprehension(s) will now be ignored and the next enclosing macro will be checked to see if it is a `Modular`. - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#273](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/273) - While typing, before `:` in keyword pairs, after the `when`, such as in `@spec foo(id) :: id when id` before finishing typing `@spec foo(id) :: id when id: String.t`, the keyword key will be properly highlighted as a Type Parameter - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
* [#276](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/276) - [@KronicDeth](https://github.com/KronicDeth)
  * Properly handle the `Infix#rightOperand` being `null` due to the Pratt Parser matching up through the operator and then ignoring the mismatched right operand, which leads to the `Infix` having only 2 elements: the left operand and the operator.
  * `@doc` and other module attributes appearing as the right operand of `@type name ::` will be ignored as it is common when adding a new type above pre-existing, documented functions.
  * Only error in `Infix#leftOperand` if there are not 2-3 children for `Infix` instead of a strict 3.

### Incompatible Changes
* [#276](https://github.com/KronicDeth/intellij-elixir/pull/276) - Drop support for IntelliJ 14.0 because the parser generated by Grammar Kit 1.3.0 is not compatible with the OpenAPI libraries shipped in IntelliJ 14.0.
